[13:08][13:9] denis : yes, i've seen it also.
[13:08][13:16] mirek : i saw it, and i think this on is re this one is really nice, it's uh, you know, all a all of you knows the the story, so.
[13:09][13:12] agnes : yes, i haven't seen i heard about it, but
[13:14][13:16] agnes : yes.
[13:17][13:17] agnes : yes.
[13:17][13:31] mirek : uh it's quite hi it's quite high ranked, so i think uh it's not a bad movie, i'm uh thinking whether there was some good occasion, uh something what has happened recently. there was something like a celebration of the
[13:32][13:35] mirek : fifty years after the war or something recently, no?
[13:35][14:4] andrei : i think there was a celebration of uh sixty years from the liberation of the camps, actually. because they were liberated beginning forty five and uh yes, it's not bad, and it's also i think it's a good idea at at least from my point of view it's coherent with the previous films, like history, im major events. i don't know if we want to keep this coherence, or change radically, but maybe yes, that's yes, i think it's a drawback uh.
[13:36][13:39] andrei : sixty. s sixty years.
[13:36][13:37] denis : no, that's
[13:39][13:42] mirek : sixty, yes. s it can't be fifty, sure.
[13:44][13:46] denis : yes, so.
[13:53][13:55] agnes : yes. yes. that's right, yes.
[13:54][13:54] mirek : that's true.
[13:59][14:3] agnes : it's a fairly emotional movie though. that's one thing to keep in mind is that it's
[14:02][14:14] denis : but then it's not representative of the nineties. it's more a movie about the story of uh the horror of the uh endured by the jewish during the second world war.
[14:14][14:25] agnes : yes, but amadeus isn't really representative of the eighties either. yes, and according to your thing it's nineteen eighty four, so.
[14:16][14:22] andrei : well, of the seventeen eighties.
[14:16][14:20] denis : yes, right.
[14:22][14:24] agnes : yes. yes yes yes.
[14:22][14:24] agnes : yes. maybe it's representative of a style of the eighties, i don't know. as for amadeus, but uh that's i don't know. but
[14:24][14:34] agnes : yes. maybe it's representative of a style of the eighties, i don't know. as for amadeus, but uh that's i don't know. but
[14:30][14:31] denis : yes, yes.
[14:33][14:39] mirek : but even here i wouldn't uh uh say that the that th this style is representative of the nineties, right, so.
[14:34][14:39] andrei : yes, hard to tell.
[14:39][14:39] denis : no.
[14:39][14:40] andrei : yes, hard to tell.
[14:42][14:48] mirek : ok, but uh anyway, i think it's it's really a good movie, i like it when i saw it and uh ok.
[14:45][14:46] agnes : it is a good movie, yes.
[14:48][14:51] denis : ok, and steven steven spielberg is uh
[14:49][14:59] mirek : it's one of the candidates, i defini yes, steven spielberg is really quite a good so i director, so i i would say we we could think about it. so i would keep it as a candidate, at least.
[14:52][14:52] agnes : yes.
[14:56][14:57] denis : ok.
[14:58][14:59] agnes : yes.
[15:00][15:1] mirek : that's the second one.
[15:01][15:4] denis : ok, the usual suspect, do we want to say something again about it, or
[15:03][15:7] denis : no. i think we can just skip this slide.
[15:06][15:8] denis : how come it's coming third
[15:09][15:10] agnes : on your list?
[15:11][15:11] agnes : yes.

[15:13][15:21] mirek : it's forth on agnes's uh and on my list, but it's ok. ah you j you selected some movies, no? you didn't take the six first.
[15:19][15:21] mirek : that's strange, what is the rating?
[15:21][15:44] andrei : yes, it's funny actually because on your on your slides actually the ratings are eight point seven for both. no they have the same, usual suspects and pulp fiction, both are at eight point seven, but on denis's table uh this one is at eight point six. who knows, maybe people voted for it, yes. could have changed in the meanwhile.
[15:24][15:25] mirek : perhaps it has changed.
[15:29][15:29] mirek : it's higher.
[15:36][15:39] agnes : but it gets updated daily.

[15:45][15:47] denis : and me on tuesday, probably.
[15:45][15:54] andrei : though with one hundred and thousand votes, it shouldn't change too much. i mean, given the nber of votes, i wonder but anyway, it's m it may change i think, yes.
[15:46][15:47] agnes : yes.
[15:53][15:55] mirek : so it probably has changed, so
[15:56][16:2] denis : ok. wow. that's encouraging.
[15:57][16:1] mirek : it becomes more popular, no po uh yes, yes, yes.
[15:59][16:4] denis : ok. do we have something to add on this movie, or
[16:04][16:5] denis : no.
[16:05][16:6] denis : no.
