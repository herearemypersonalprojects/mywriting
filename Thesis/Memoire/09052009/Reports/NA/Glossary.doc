\begin{itemize}
\item {Stem: According to the Summer Institute of Linguistics International \url{http://www.sil.org}, a stem or word stem is a root or roots of a word that is common to all its inflected variants. }

\item {Lemma: A lemma in morphology is defined as a canonical form of a set of words that have the same original meaning \cite{clement2004mba}. A lemma is different from a stem that a lemma of the verb may change when morphologically inflected, however a stem that never changes by a morphology. For example, for the word "modified", its lemma is "modify" while the stem is "modifi" because we have words such as \textbf{modifi}cation.}

\item {Morphology: \textit{"The morphology of the language is defined in terms of a set M of relations between word forms"} \cite{miller1995wld}}

\item {Keyword: A keyword is defined as any important word that will help an automatic machine answer a question \cite{buscaldi2007ngv}}

\item {Part-of-speech tagger: A programme determines category of a word as a noun, a verb, an adjective,... based on definition of the word and the sentence that the word belong to. \cite{manson1997qpp}}

\item {Stopword: It is a word such as "the", "to" or "for" which generally add little or no information regarding the subject matter of a document \cite{mckechnie2001cap}}

\item {Punctuation marks: According to Todd, Loreto (2000), in a text except letters and numbers, others are punctuation marks.}

\item {Synonym: A synonym of a word is another word that they share at least one sense in common \cite{miller1995wld}. }

\item {Dynamic Search Window: That is a window used for block-matched algorithm in information retrieval by moving this window to all data blocks as possible. A dynamic search window has dynamic parameters (size and step) that depend on input data. \cite{goharian2008dsp}. In this case, a window moves to all passages as possible in the transcript to retrieve a relevant passage.}

\item {Passage: A passage can simply be defined as a sequence of words regardless sentences or paragraphs. Some text-based information retrieval systems define a passage as a fixed-length block of words \cite{goharian2008dsp}.}

\item {Passage Score: In text-based question answering system, the score of a passage is based on score of its words with respect to question words. The score of a question word found in a passage is computed based on definition of this word and/or relations of this word with other words in the text \cite{tellex2003qep}.}

\item {Passage Retrieval Algorithm: Its objective is to determine a passage that is the most likely to contain information that help for answering a question \cite{tellex2003qep}.}

\item {Meeting Browser: It is a tool that help humans find relevant information from past meetings in multimedia archives of meeting recordings \cite{popescubelis:tbe}.}

\item {BET: Browser Evaluation Test. This is a method for assessing the performance of a meeting browser on meeting recordings \cite{BET}.}

\item {Observation of interest: They are statements about a fact related to a meeting collected by independent observers in order to perform an evaluation for meeting browsers according to the Browser Evaluation Test (BET) method \cite{BET}.}

\item {Observers: They watch selected meetings from corpus, to produce a set of \textit{observations of interest}}.

\item {BET Questions: They are questions or \textit{Observations of interest} used in  the BET method \cite{popescubelis:tbe}.}

\item {Human Subjects: They are persons who answer BET questions using a meeting browser \cite{BET} and their answers are used to evaluate the performance of this browser.}

\item {Corpus: A set of meeting recordings }

\item {Question-Answering System: A text-based system allows users ask a question in natural language and receive an exact and succinct answer in place of a list of documents that may contain the answer \cite{hirschman2002nlq, kato2004hia}.}

\item {Deductive Question: It is difficult to answer this type of questions. Firstly, it comes from the difference expression between strings from question and strings from answer. This is the biggest challenges for question answering \cite{brill2002diq}. Secondly, this question type demands to seek a fact rather a clear explanation in the text, for example for "How" and "Why" questions. They are difficult for all question answering systems \cite{prager2000qap}.}

 
\item {ASR meeting transcript: Meeting transcripts are generated by Automatic Speech Recognition \cite{BET}.}

\item {ASR summaries: They are generated by an automated summarizer based on ASR meeting transcripts \cite{ASR_summaries}.}

\item {Cross-Validation method: This method is used to test a configuration of a system for an accuracy estimation in the case that the system does not have enough data to test \cite{kohavi1995scv}.}

\item {N-gram matching: In textual information retrieval, this method is used to estimate similarity between two string by examining all n-grams matchings, where an n-gram is a substring of n words \cite{robertson1998ang}.}

\item {TREC: The Text Retrieval Conferences \url{http://trec.nist.gov/}. This is an series of workshops for a list of different information retrieval research which question answering belongs to.}
