[0:48][0:49] andrei : hi everyone
[0:49][0:56] denis : so i don't know if you all received the the a agenda for this meeting
[0:49][0:56] denis : do you no
[0:55][0:56] mirek : no i haven't
[0:57][0:57] denis : here it is
[0:57][0:57] mirek : thank you
[0:58][0:59] andrei : i haven't
[0:59][1:27] denis : so the goal for today are
[0:59][1:27] denis : we have two goals uh
[0:59][1:27] denis : first is to decide a movie for uh the next projection for our movie club
[0:59][1:27] denis : as you know uh so it's for the last friday of this month of april
[0:59][1:27] denis : as you probably remember the movie already projected were uh lawrence of arabia and apocalypse now in february and amadeus from milos forman in march
[1:27][1:55] denis : so the question that is open is
[1:27][1:55] denis : are we going to select a movie from the nineties and which movie
[1:27][1:55] denis : so that's the first goal decide for a movie to be projected
[1:27][1:55] denis : and second goal is to uh discuss for an ad advertising poster for our uh club
[1:27][1:55] denis : because we noticed that n last time not enough people came to the projection
[1:56][2:1] denis : so that's it
[1:56][2:1] denis : wh who wants to start to
[2:03][2:7] denis : so i guess you all prepared some docents for the selection of movie
[2:07][2:9] agnes : yes
[2:08][2:12] andrei : yes
[2:08][2:8] denis : ok
[2:30][2:35] agnes : yes
[2:08][2:12] andrei : so who who has what actually maybe
[2:11][2:14] agnes : i've got a powerpoint presentation
[2:14][2:15] denis : ok
[2:14][2:16] andrei : uhhuh
[2:14][2:16] andrei : what do you have mirek
[2:16][2:22] mirek : ok i have a powerpoint presentation
[2:16][2:22] mirek : and uh it's about
[2:16][2:22] mirek : there are some reviews of the of the i think like seven movies
[2:22][2:31] andrei : uhhuh
[2:22][2:31] andrei : and i have a uh well just a a piece of paper with some suggestions
[2:22][2:31] andrei : what about you denis
[2:30][2:35] denis : yes i have also uh a piece of paper with uh my favourite movie
[2:35][2:35] andrei : uhhuh
[2:36][2:37] denis : ok so
[2:36][2:39] andrei : should we start with the two presentations maybe
[2:38][2:41] denis : presentation yes
[2:36][2:39] andrei : yes
[2:38][2:41] denis : ok
[2:30][2:35] denis : a
[2:38][2:41] denis : agnes we can start with you
[2:41][2:41] agnes : sure
[2:43][2:45] agnes : it's not very long in any case
[2:46][2:47] denis : ok here it is
[2:47][2:51] agnes : yes
[2:48][2:49] denis : i pass this one
[2:52][3:16] agnes : yes
[2:52][3:16] agnes : ok so
[2:52][3:16] agnes : what i was thinking is basically the previous movies that we had which you've already mentioned in the agenda d lawrence of arabia apocalypse now and amadeus were fairly historical serious dramatic and also actioney movies except for maybe amadeus
[2:52][3:16] agnes : this month i was thinking of selecting something that's more in the present time still dramatic but slightly less serious
[3:17][3:52] agnes : and what i'd propose is something of a thriller or mystery
[3:17][3:52] agnes : and i know that a lot of people find mystery is not really mysterious in the movies these days they kind of can predict what's gonna happen but in the nineties there were some movies that did have surprise endings and that people came out saying ok didn't see that coming
[3:17][3:52] agnes : so i thought we could maybe show one of those
[3:17][3:52] agnes : and even if people have already seen the movie a lot of the times you go back and watch the movie again and you pick up on things that you didn't really notice the first time around or you see where the clues were and what led up to the end
[3:17][3:52] agnes : so that's more along the lines of what i was thinking
[3:53][3:56] agnes : and the two in particular that i would propose are
[3:57][4:35] agnes : next slide please
[3:57][4:35] agnes : the usual suspects and the sixth sense
[3:57][4:35] agnes : i don't know if you've seen any of them
[3:57][4:35] agnes : uh the usual suspects was directed by bryan singer and written by christopher mcquarrie
[3:57][4:35] agnes : it has a fairly large cast so i'm not gonna read all of them but the main characters are kevin spacey and gabriel byrne
[3:57][4:35] agnes : and it's basically about five criminals who get set up
[3:57][4:35] agnes : they're arrested they're released from prison and the get together and plan a crime and basically the story is told through the views of one of the suspects
[4:35][4:59] agnes : the tag line is kind of neat five criminals one lineup no coincidence and you get told the story as uh that these f characters are being controlled by one sort of ubervillain and in the end you find who the ubervillain was
[4:35][4:59] agnes : and i kind of like the the quote from rolling stone magazine the usual suspects is the freshest funniest
[4:58][5:4] denis : which which one was it again
[4:58][5:4] denis : the guy who was controlling
[4:58][5:4] denis : i don't remember i have seen the movie twice but uh
[5:03][5:5] agnes : well they ha
[5:03][5:5] agnes : have you guys seen the movie
[5:05][5:6] andrei : no i haven't seen it
[5:06][5:6] mirek : no i haven't
[5:06][5:8] denis : it's the bald guy the
[5:07][5:24] agnes : so i'm not gonna give away
[5:07][5:24] agnes : you want me to give away the movie
[5:10][5:15] denis : no no
[5:07][5:24] agnes : that'll spoil it
[5:10][5:15] denis : ok
[5:07][5:24] agnes : i'll tell you later
[5:07][5:24] agnes : but the the quote from rolling stone is fairly accurate i think it's one of the freshest funniest and scariest crime thrillers to come along since pulp fiction
[5:25][5:42] agnes : and the other movie is the sixth sense with the famous line i see dead people which the little boy says
[5:25][5:42] agnes : it was written and directed by m_ night uh shyamalan and stars bruce willis haley joel osment and toni collette and again has a neat twist that you find out right at the end
[5:43][5:47] denis : yes it's a bit more commercial that one the first one
[5:46][5:46] agnes : yes
[5:47][5:50] agnes : yes the sixth sense was very commercial but
[5:51][5:52] agnes : anyways
[5:51][5:57] andrei : so w what what is this s the second image on the slide
[5:51][5:57] andrei : is it the the poster or
[5:56][6:1] agnes : it's the poster for the sixth sense but unfortunately i couldn't find a clear big enough one
[6:01][6:8] andrei : has a s it has a strange format horizontal and
[6:04][6:28] agnes : yes
[6:04][6:28] agnes : yes i th i think it's only part of a full yes it goes th the all of the se all of the senses
[6:04][6:28] andrei : oh so it's one two three four five six
[6:04][6:28] agnes : if you go to the next slide there's slightly more detailed things about the movies
[6:04][6:28] agnes : so the usual suspects is a hundred and five minutes long so it's a decent length of time
[6:04][6:28] agnes : it has an r_ rating so i don't remember what type of audience we had at the last uh shows but it may not necessarily be suitable for kids
[6:32][6:33] denis : r_ is what uh in
[6:34][6:38] agnes : r_ is sort of if you're eighteen and under you have to have an adult with you
[6:38][6:38] denis : ok
[6:38][6:41] andrei : so it means restricted uhhuh
[6:39][7:2] agnes : it's mostly for violence yes it's restricted
[6:40][6:41] denis : restricted
[6:39][7:2] agnes : it got an eight point seven out of ten on the internet movie database
[6:39][7:2] agnes : it's the sixteenth in the top f two hundred and fifty movies and fourth in the top movies of the nineties
[6:39][7:2] agnes : it won a couple of academy awards notably for best writing so that's for the script and best actor for kevin spacey
[7:02][7:10] denis : but wait i
[7:02][7:10] denis : i have the top ten from the nineties
[7:02][7:10] denis : no the top fifty
[7:02][7:10] denis : and it's fourth
[7:11][7:16] agnes : yes fourth in the top movies of the nineties
[7:13][7:15] denis : oh sorry sorry yes yes yes
[7:11][7:16] agnes : sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty i think of all time
[7:16][7:20] andrei : yes because your table is only the nineties yes
[7:18][7:20] denis : from yes yes yes
[7:19][7:19] agnes : yes
[7:19][7:20] mirek : nineties yes
[7:20][7:33] agnes : so it won lots of awards it won best film from the british british film association the british equivalent of the academy awards
[7:20][7:33] agnes : it was nominated for best foreign film for the cesar
[7:33][7:35] mirek : so plenty of awards we we could say
[7:34][7:41] denis : but but sixteenth in top two hundred fifty it's what two uh all all days
[7:34][7:36] agnes : plenty of awards yes
[7:35][7:36] andrei : well
[7:39][7:41] agnes : i think of all time yes
[7:40][7:41] mirek : of all the movies yes yes
[7:41][7:42] denis : all times
[7:41][7:42] agnes : yes
[7:43][7:44] agnes : so
[7:44][7:46] mirek : it's still good actually
[7:44][7:45] denis : ok
[7:45][7:45] agnes : yes
[7:46][7:50] denis : but those rating are more like uh it's the nber of votes no
[7:46][7:47] andrei : w w
[7:50][7:53] agnes : yes it's ratings by viewers and
[7:52][7:53] denis : votes and u
[7:52][7:53] mirek : by the users
[6:29][6:33] andrei : no
[7:52][8:11] andrei : no actually if you look at your tables
[7:52][8:11] andrei : i think it's a sort of uh well average between nber of votes and and and uh yes the the rating or th the marks
[7:54][7:55] denis : yes
[7:58][7:59] denis : and rating
[7:52][8:11] andrei : because there are in your table you have uh things that have very few votes but still are ranked quite high
[8:07][8:7] denis : yes
[8:07][8:9] agnes : yes like memories
[7:52][8:11] andrei : for instance nber twenty four which has only four thousand votes
[8:08][8:8] denis : yes yes
[8:09][8:10] mirek : %
[8:11][8:16] agnes : yes and forty four as well which has seven hundred and forty something votes
[8:12][8:13] andrei : but yes
[8:15][8:24] mirek : so it's definitely just the average of the rating and
[8:15][8:24] denis : yes
[8:15][8:24] mirek : ok th the nber of the votes is there just for the information so that you know how how reliable yes
[8:15][8:16] andrei : yes
[8:20][8:32] andrei : maybe it's just the search is compensated a bit for the nber of people
[8:20][8:32] mirek : yes
[8:20][8:32] andrei : i i don't know actually
[8:20][8:32] andrei : because if you have just ten votes and yes probably are not in the database
[8:15][8:24] mirek : ok
[8:29][8:32] mirek : ok then you yes
[8:29][8:32] mirek : then yes yes yes yes sure
[8:33][8:34] agnes : yes so
[8:33][8:38] andrei : but yes anyway it has excellent votes
[8:34][8:35] denis : ok yes
[8:25][8:26] agnes : yes
[8:33][8:38] andrei : haven't seen it but
[8:35][8:37] agnes : yes
[8:37][8:51] agnes : that's a good movie i i highly recoend it
[8:37][8:51] agnes : and i wouldn't mind seeing it again because i do know the ending and i haven't been able to watch it again to see where the hints were that were scattered across the movie 'cause apparently there are hints as to who it is
[8:44][8:45] mirek : %
[8:50][8:52] denis : ah now i remember
[8:51][8:52] andrei : oh
[8:52][8:55] agnes : yes ok
[8:37][8:51] mirek : yes
[8:53][8:54] denis : yes
[8:57][9:4] denis : actually there is one guy who is the at the police station and they ask him to tell the story yes yes
[8:54][8:55] agnes : yes
[9:01][9:3] agnes : and he's the one telling the story yes
[9:05][9:7] agnes : there's him and the the guy in the burn unit
[9:00][9:0] andrei : yes
[9:07][9:8] mirek : and what is the second movie
[9:08][9:44] agnes : the second movie is the sixth sense
[9:09][9:10] mirek : yes sixth sen
[9:08][9:44] agnes : again it's fairly short
[9:08][9:44] agnes : it has an easier rating it's p_g_ thirteen it's much less violent
[9:08][9:44] agnes : it got an eight point one out of ten it's a hundred and first in the top two hundred and fifty and it's nineteenth on your list i think if i'm not mistaken
[9:08][9:44] agnes : yes it's nineteenth
[9:08][9:44] agnes : got a fair nber of votes too ninety six thousand
[9:08][9:44] agnes : again it was nominated for a lot of different academy awards it didn't win any but it got a lot of buzz and a lot of people liked it so
[9:46][9:57] agnes : those are my two selections and as you can see the plot is a boy who counicates with spirits that don't know when they're dead seeks the help of a disheartened child psychologist to figure out why he's seeing what he's seeing and what it means
[10:00][10:7] denis : both movies are quite similar in some way because the last sentence is uh totally contradictory to the whole movie it's uh
[9:07][9:10] agnes : yes
[10:07][10:8] agnes : yes
[10:09][10:11] andrei : the last sentence from the movie or oh
[10:10][10:12] denis : yes the last sentence from the movie
[10:12][10:20] agnes : yes
[10:12][10:20] andrei : w
[10:12][10:20] agnes : it's only right right at the end where you find out really what's going on and it makes you rethink everything that happened beforehand
[10:16][10:16] denis : yes
[10:22][10:31] agnes : so those would be my two suggestions and y they ar they are slightly more coercial or at leas the sixth sense is than the other ones we've seen but
[10:32][10:39] andrei : so these guys were actually nominated
[10:32][10:39] andrei : so the the bottom part of your slide actually
[10:32][10:39] agnes : yes
[10:32][10:39] andrei : it says yes
[10:32][10:39] andrei : so these are the best awards they had
[10:40][10:44] agnes : yes they were they were nominated for a lot of different awards they didn't win
[10:44][10:50] andrei : ok
[10:44][10:50] andrei : too bad
[10:45][10:48] agnes : but i guess the comp i can't remember what the competition was that year but
[10:44][10:50] andrei : well there is just one winner so
[10:44][10:50] andrei : uhhuh
[10:50][10:53] agnes : and they were nominated for a lot of them and
[10:34][10:35] agnes : yes
[10:41][10:42] denis : ok
[10:56][10:59] agnes : so i think that's it unless you have any questions
[10:56][10:58] andrei : ok
[10:56][10:58] denis : you have a last slide or no
[10:56][10:59] agnes : yes that's it
[11:01][11:13] mirek : ok now you can go to to my slides
[10:56][10:57] denis : ok
[11:01][11:13] mirek : but actually what i pre what i have prepared is just a kind of a review of fo uh se six or seven movies
[11:01][11:13] mirek : if you ca can go to the second slide
[11:12][11:15] agnes : you sent your slides around right
[11:14][12:0] mirek : yes basically seven movies and it's uh it's uh uh top movies uh based on the uh on the ra ranking and a and awards awards
[10:54][10:55] agnes : yes
[11:14][12:0] mirek : you see the the names of the movies on the on the on the wall
[11:14][12:0] mirek : so we can perhaps go through all of them and we can little bit discuss
[11:14][12:0] mirek : so i i i have n i didn't see all of them actually
[11:14][12:0] mirek : so it's just
[11:14][12:0] mirek : we should probably select one of these because i think uh these are really good movies and uh ok we will see
[11:14][12:0] mirek : so if you can go through uh ok
[11:03][11:4] denis : ok
[11:14][12:0] mirek : so this is the first movie and uh it's it's m it's more like a drama
[11:14][12:0] mirek : uh it's uh it's uh very uh high ranked
[11:14][12:0] mirek : and actually you have a a nicer list because uh we can even see the nber of the votes
[11:58][12:3] denis : yes one hundred f w uh one hundred forty thousand
[11:14][12:0] mirek : so what is the nber of the people
[12:01][12:3] andrei : yes i think your table is very clear denis
[12:04][12:10] mirek : finally i found actually your table much better than my than my presentation because perhaps here we can we can really see i mean
[12:10][12:14] denis : no we don't have the plot of the of the movie and uh
[12:11][12:13] mirek : what is the ranking
[12:11][12:13] mirek : we ha didn't have the plot yes
[12:16][12:21] denis : ok but maybe we can wh who has seen this movie
[12:20][12:24] mirek : yes who has seen this movie
[12:21][12:28] agnes : no i haven't
[12:20][12:24] mirek : because then perhaps someone can give some some coent
[12:22][12:23] andrei : no i haven't
[12:21][12:28] agnes : i've heard a lot of good things about it i've heard it's a really powerful movie but i haven't seen it
[12:22][12:23] denis : i uh
[11:12][11:15] andrei : yes
[12:25][12:28] denis : i think i i i've seen it actually but
[12:27][12:30] andrei : w what is the name in french 'cause
[12:30][12:31] denis : i have no idea
[12:32][12:33] andrei : uhhuh uh yes
[12:33][12:37] denis : it it's in uh jail right it taking yes
[12:35][12:37] agnes : yes it's set in a jail
[12:39][12:41] denis : i don't remember well this movie
[12:24][12:24] andrei : yes
[12:39][12:45] andrei : well actually your third slide has the plot so uh
[12:45][12:50] mirek : yes it's this one
[12:39][12:45] andrei : yes
[12:45][12:50] mirek : it's the one that is on the on the wall
[12:45][12:50] denis : yes
[12:46][12:46] agnes : yes
[12:45][12:50] mirek : it's projected yes
[12:48][12:54] andrei : oh yes exactly yes
[12:49][12:50] denis : ok ok
[12:48][12:54] andrei : so yes this guy is jailed ok
[12:48][12:54] andrei : uhhuh wow
[12:54][12:55] denis : ok so
[12:55][13:3] mirek : so i ge ok so no one of us saw this movie so in that case perhaps it's it's little bit danger to select that movie for the for the
[11:44][11:45] andrei : ok
[12:57][12:59] denis : yes so let's
[12:47][12:47] andrei : yes
[13:04][13:7] mirek : s play so uh schindler's list
[13:04][13:7] mirek : who saw this
[13:07][13:7] agnes : me
[13:08][13:9] denis : yes i've seen it also
[13:08][13:16] mirek : i saw it and i think this on is re this one is really nice
[13:09][13:12] andrei : yes i haven't seen i heard about it but
[13:08][13:16] mirek : it's uh you know all a all of you knows the the story so
[12:47][12:47] andrei : yes
[12:58][12:58] andrei : yes
[13:17][13:31] mirek : uh it's quite hi it's quite high ranked
[13:17][13:31] mirek : so i think uh it's not a bad movie
[13:17][13:31] mirek : i'm uh thinking whether there was some good occasion uh something what has happened recently
[13:17][13:31] mirek : there was something like a celebration of the fifty years after the war or something recently no
[13:35][14:4] andrei : i think there was a celebration of uh sixty years from the liberation of the camps actually
[13:36][13:39] denis : sixty s sixty years
[13:36][13:37] mirek : no that's
[13:39][13:42] mirek : sixty yes s it can't be fifty sure
[13:35][14:4] andrei : because they were liberated beginning forty five and uh
[13:44][13:46] mirek : yes so
[13:35][14:4] andrei : yes it's not bad
[13:35][14:4] andrei : and it's also i think it's a good idea at at least from my point of view it's coherent with the previous films
[13:35][14:4] andrei : like history im major events
[13:53][13:55] denis : yes yes that's right yes
[13:54][13:54] mirek : that's true
[13:35][14:4] andrei : i don't know if we want to keep this coherence or change radically but maybe
[13:59][14:3] agnes : it's a fairly emotional movie though
[13:35][14:4] andrei : yes that's yes i think it's a drawback u
[13:59][14:3] agnes : that's one thing to keep in mind is that it's
[14:02][14:14] denis : but then it's not representative of the nineties
[14:02][14:14] denis : it's more a movie about the story of uh the horror of the uh endured by the jewish during the second world war
[14:14][14:25] agnes : yes but amadeus isn't really representative of the eighties either
[14:16][14:20] denis : yes right
[14:16][14:22] andrei : well of the seventeen eighties
[14:14][14:25] agnes : yes and according to your thing it's nineteen eighty four so
[14:22][14:24] mirek : yes yes yes yes
[13:14][13:16] andrei : yes
[14:22][14:24] andrei : maybe it's representative of a style of the eighties i don't know
[14:22][14:24] andrei : as for amadeus but uh
[14:30][14:31] denis : yes yes
[14:22][14:24] andrei : that's i don't know but
[14:33][14:39] mirek : but even here i wouldn't uh uh say that the that th this style is representative of the nineties right so
[14:39][14:39] agnes : no
[14:34][14:39] andrei : yes hard to tell
[14:42][14:48] mirek : ok but uh anyway i think it's it's really a good movie i like it when i saw it and uh ok
[14:45][14:46] agnes : it is a good movie yes
[14:48][14:51] denis : ok and steven steven spielberg is uh
[14:49][14:59] mirek : it's one of the candidates i defini yes
[14:49][14:59] mirek : steven spielberg is really quite a good so i director
[13:17][13:17] agnes : yes
[14:49][14:59] mirek : so i i would say we we could think about it
[12:55][12:56] denis : ok
[14:49][14:59] mirek : so i would keep it as a candidate at least
[14:22][14:24] agnes : yes
[15:00][15:1] mirek : that's the second one
[15:01][15:4] denis : ok the usual suspect do we want to say something again about it or
15:03][15:7] mirek : no
[15:03][15:7] mirek : i think we can just skip this slide
[15:06][15:8] denis : how come it's coming third
[15:09][15:10] denis : on your list
[14:24][14:34] agnes : yes
[15:11][15:12] mirek : uh yes
[15:11][15:12] mirek : it's
[2:38][2:41] denis : it's fourth on agnes's uh and on my list but it's ok
[15:13][15:21] denis : ah you j you selected some movies no
[15:13][15:21] denis : you didn't take the six first
[15:19][15:21] mirek : that's strange what is the rating
[15:21][15:44] andrei : yes it's funny actually
[15:24][15:25] mirek : perhaps it has changed
[15:21][15:44] andrei : because on your on your slides actually the ratings are eight point seven for both
[15:29][15:29] mirek : it's higher
[15:21][15:44] andrei : no they have the same usual suspects and pulp fiction both are at eight point seven
[15:21][15:44] andrei : but on denis's table uh this one is at eight point six
[15:36][15:39] agnes : but it gets updated daily
[15:38][15:39] mirek : it gets updated
[15:21][15:44] andrei : who knows maybe people voted for it yes
[15:41][15:44] mirek : yes yes and i did it i did it on wednesday
[14:39][14:40] agnes : yes
[15:21][15:44] andrei : could have changed in the meanwhile
[15:45][15:47] denis : and me on tuesday probably
[15:45][15:54] andrei : though with one hundred and thousand votes it shouldn't change too much
[14:52][14:52] mirek : yes
[15:45][15:54] andrei : i mean given the nber of votes i wonder
[15:45][15:54] andrei : but anyway it's m it may change i think yes
[15:53][15:55] mirek : so it probably has changed so
[14:56][14:57] andrei : ok
[15:57][16:1] mirek : it becomes more popular no po uh yes yes yes
[15:13][15:21] denis : ok
[15:56][16:2] andrei : wow
[15:56][16:2] andrei : that's encouraging
[15:59][16:4] denis : do we have something to add on this movie or
[16:04][16:05] agnes : no
[16:04][16:05] andrei : no
[16:06][16:06] denis : ok
[16:07][16:13] agnes : wait how many of us saw schindler's list
[16:07][16:13] agnes : three of us
[16:07][16:13] agnes : did you see it
[16:07][16:13] agnes : i'm just trying to keep track of how many of us have seen
[16:12][16:16] mirek : uh schindler's list
[16:14][16:14] denis : yes
[16:15][16:17] agnes : you have
[16:12][16:16] mirek : i saw it i saw it
[16:15][16:17] agnes : you have
[16:16][16:16] denis : yes
[16:15][16:17] agnes : you haven't
[16:16][16:17] andrei : haven't
[16:18][16:24] andrei : uh i i've seen very few movies from the list about ten out of the first fifty
[16:21][16:21] mirek : %
[16:23][16:27] denis : that's why you are in the movie club to see more movies
[16:25][16:27] andrei : ok yes
[16:28][16:54] mirek : ok pulp fiction
[16:28][16:54] mirek : uh i think it's again quite uh hi high ranked uh
[16:28][16:54] mirek : but from my perspective everyone already saw it
[16:28][16:54] mirek : who was interested in that movie he saw it
[16:28][16:54] mirek : wh who is not interested in that movie he he didn't see it and he uh wouldn't uh like to see it in the in our movie club
[16:28][16:54] mirek : so i think we should uh we should just leave skip it out and leave it out
[16:28][16:54] mirek : i i wouldn't think about this as a candidate even if it's a good movie but i don't know i think it's
[16:52][16:58] denis : why not
[16:52][16:58] denis : it's quite representative of the nineties i think
[16:52][16:58] denis : and the structure of the movie is interesting
[17:00][17:7] denis : i i think the the first scene is actually the same scene as the last scene no
[17:00][17:7] denis : there is a kind of loop in this movie
[17:06][17:7] agnes : i can't remember
[17:08][17:12] mirek : yes yes there was ple i i think there was a plenty of loops actually plenty of
[15:41][15:42] denis : yes
[17:21][17:35] mirek : i fully agree that you can see this movie three times perhaps three times and for the fourth time see you still discover something new
[17:23][17:25] denis : yes yes
[17:23][17:25] denis : i agree also yes
[17:21][17:35] mirek : but uh on the other hand i have the impression it's really it's uh you know every everyone saw it it's it's quite well known uh it woul it wou i
[17:34][17:37] denis : you've you've seen it
[17:35][17:40] andrei : yes i've seen it this one
[17:35][17:40] denis : ok
[17:35][17:40] mirek : yes
[17:35][17:40] andrei : i i like it very much
[17:38][17:39] agnes : so we've all seen it
[17:38][17:43] denis : and the soundtrack is uh is gorgeous also no
[17:35][17:40] andrei : i've actually seen it
[17:42][17:42] agnes : is what
[17:38][17:43] denis : the soundtrack
[17:43][17:45] agnes : i haven't i don't remember the soundtrack
[9:46][9:57] denis : no
[17:45][17:47] mirek : me neither
[17:45][17:52] andrei : well it's plenty of well known songs and you know the twist thing and
[17:50][17:50] denis : yes yes
[17:50][17:56] mirek : so what do you think
[17:50][17:56] mirek : i i wouldn't think about this as a candidate because it seems to me it's
[17:55][18:3] andrei : oh i would keep it as a candidate but
[17:55][18:3] andrei : i don't know i think for the moment m m
[17:55][18:3] andrei : guess most of these are candidates so we'll try to
[18:03][18:5] denis : w w we vote at the end or you want to
[18:05][18:8] andrei : yes we should probably vote after everyone
[18:06][18:11] agnes : yes i mean if there's something that none of us like we can just eliminate it but we might as well leave everything 'till the end
[18:06][18:8] mirek : vote that's the best yes yes
[18:06][18:11] andrei : yes
[18:06][18:11] denis : ok
[18:06][18:11] andrei : yes
[18:11][18:17] mirek : when going through we c we could just eliminate
[18:11][18:17] mirek : ok so we are not gonna eliminate this one
[18:11][18:17] mirek : uh goodfellas i didn't see it
[18:11][18:19] agnes : no
[18:11][18:19] andrei : no
[18:11][18:19] denis : no
[18:11][18:19] mirek : no
[18:19][18:33] mirek : but you can read the coent from the users uh that's the that's the last uh bullet point and it says uh simply a masterpiece uh and it's uh scorsese's last really great movie to date
[18:25][18:27] denis : ah it's scorsese's
[18:27][18:31] agnes : yes
[18:31][18:35] denis : it's uh yes again a movie about uh on mafia no

[18:46][18:50] denis : on the r on the right you mean

[18:45][18:52] agnes : and the guy on the left is ray liotta
[18:52][18:58] andrei : i you you recognise them or you can read the the text on the images
[18:55][18:57] agnes : i recognise them
[18:52][18:58] andrei : oh ok
[18:58][19:2] agnes : i'm a movie buff i know way too much about movies and actors and everything
[18:59][19:1] andrei : huh very well
[19:01][19:9] denis : it's the exact same actors who played in another mafia movie that i cannot rememb ^les affranchis^ it was the name in french
[16:04][16:5] denis : no
[19:09][19:10] agnes : what was it about
[19:11][19:25] denis : about uh mafia uh it
[19:13][19:17] agnes : very descriptive
[19:11][19:25] denis : that's why i tha that's why i didn't go to see this one
[19:11][19:25] denis : it's quite i it seems to me they're all about the same subject and the same i don't know
[19:25][19:29] mirek : and it's a movie from nineties
[18:08][18:10] andrei : yes
[19:25][19:29] mirek : the one that you saw that you mentioned
[19:30][19:31] denis : probably yes
[18:10][18:11] mirek : yes
[19:35][19:37] denis : ok n nobody's seen it so
[19:34][19:39] andrei : ok
[19:34][19:39] andrei : no yes so probably not uh
[19:39][19:39] mirek : no
[19:39][19:39] agnes : no
[19:39][19:41] mirek : silence of the lambs uh
[18:10][18:11] denis : ok
[19:42][19:58] mirek : should i tell something more
[19:42][19:58] mirek : godfather of all thrillers that's what it what it says on the
[19:42][19:58] mirek : what some uh user says
[19:42][19:58] mirek : uh so ok it's a little bit horror so i think it's quite it's uh it's uh
[19:55][20:0] agnes : a little bit
[19:59][20:5] mirek : it's definitely not for kids uh but uh if the kids are not visitors of our cinema why not
[19:34][19:39] agnes : ok
[19:39][19:39] agnes : yes
[20:09][20:14] mirek : it
[20:09][20:14] mirek : one have to rethink when when when you are watching this movie you have to think and it's uh scaring
[20:09][20:14] mirek : uh why not
[20:15][20:17] denis : so it's about a psychopathic killer
[20:20][20:23] denis : and
[20:20][20:23] denis : what was it again the plot i mea the
[20:23][20:33] mirek : so the f_b_i_ agent is assigned to to help uh find a a missing woman and uh save her f uh her from a psychopathic killer with the help of another killer
[20:34][20:37] agnes : so the other killer is hannibal lecter who
[20:37][20:37] andrei : so
[20:37][20:37] mirek : yes
[20:37][20:38] andrei : who is in prison actually
[20:37][20:40] denis : he he's in jail and he's still killing
[20:38][20:41] agnes : yes he's in jail and he's real no h
[20:38][20:40] mirek : he's in prison yes
[20:40][20:40] andrei : yes
[20:40][20:45] andrei : no no
[20:40][20:45] andrei : he tries to decrypt the the the other killers' behaviour
[20:41][20:44] denis : ah ok yes yes
[20:43][20:48] agnes : he tries to help the f_b_i_ agent but he plays head games with the f_b_i_ agent at the same time
[20:49][20:51] mirek : he's a really psychotic man
[20:49][20:54] andrei : yes well not very nasty ones
[20:50][20:51] agnes : and so
[20:49][20:54] andrei : or does he i don't know
[20:52][20:56] agnes : with her
[20:52][20:56] agnes : he manages to freak her out
[20:55][21:4] andrei : yes
[20:55][21:4] andrei : yes that's basically the point yes
[20:59][21:1] agnes : so
[20:59][21:1] agnes : hannibal lecter is a very
[20:55][21:4] andrei : so on the picture you can see uh jodie foster and uh ha ha
[20:06][20:7] denis : yes
[21:04][21:7] andrei : th th the moth
[21:04][21:5] agnes : the moth
[21:05][21:8] denis : who's playing the ps psychopath again
[21:05][21:8] denis : i don't
[21:08][21:12] agnes : which the one who's in jail or the one who
[20:37][20:37] denis : yes
[21:08][21:12] andrei : anthony hopkins
[21:11][21:17] agnes : anthony hopkins
[21:11][21:12] mirek : anthony
[21:12][21:12] denis : ok yes
[21:11][21:17] andrei : the other one i don't remember
[21:11][21:17] andrei : we don't see any h see him very often
[21:14][21:15] agnes : i don't either
[21:15][21:21] mirek : no
[21:15][21:21] mirek : but he plays it really good
[15:13][15:21] andrei : but it's
[21:15][21:21] mirek : anthony hop hopkins he really plays it very good very good yes
[21:18][21:20] agnes : yes he's scary in that movie
[20:39][20:39] andrei : yes
[20:39][20:39] mirek : so
[21:22][21:30] andrei : but the plot is quite horrible
[21:22][21:30] andrei : i mean the not the plot but the what the the active killer wants to do is quite horrible and
[21:26][21:27] mirek : %
[21:30][21:35] agnes : yes i vaguely remember what it is but
[21:35][21:37] denis : ok
[21:35][21:37] andrei : ok
[21:37][21:41] agnes : how many of us have seen it
[21:37][21:41] agnes : i'm guessing you haven't seen it or h
[21:39][21:42] denis : no i've seen it actually twice i think
[21:35][21:36] agnes : ok
[21:41][21:45] andrei : yes i've seen it
[21:41][21:45] andrei : i think i've seen it a second time on t_v_ but maybe not entirely
[21:44][21:47] agnes : so have we all seen it
[21:44][21:49] mirek : i've i've see i've seen it but i can't really remember exactly the all the details
[21:44][21:47] agnes : ok so we've all seen it
[21:49][21:51] agnes : i can't either 'cause i saw it right when it came out
[21:49][21:52] denis : that's it's it's probably begin
[21:51][21:53] mirek : uh
[21:51][21:53] mirek : it's a long time ago it's from ninety one
[21:52][21:55] agnes : it came out when ninety one yes
[21:53][21:54] denis : ninety one
[21:54][21:56] mirek : ninety one yes
[21:57][22:3] mirek : so and i saw it when i was like twelve or thirteen
[22:00][22:6] agnes : so
[22:00][22:6] agnes : yes me too
[21:57][22:3] mirek : so perhaps it would be
[22:00][22:6] agnes : and at that age i was like
[22:02][22:4] andrei : they're much too young
[20:49][20:54] denis : yes
[22:07][22:13] denis : ok american beauty w w was coming next seven was quite quite nice actually
[22:10][22:12] mirek : yes could you go to the next slide
[22:11][22:13] agnes : yes that was very good yes
[22:14][22:16] denis : ah it's actually there
[21:02][21:3] agnes : yes
[22:15][22:20] mirek : yes it's here and that's actually my last slide so
[22:20][22:22] denis : why you choose you choose seven movie
[22:22][22:27] mirek : i don't know because it nicely f i i was thinking perhaps we are not able to go through more of them
[21:35][21:36] denis : ok
[22:27][22:29] andrei : indeed
[22:30][22:46] mirek : uh
[22:30][22:46] mirek : so american beauty
[22:30][22:46] mirek : so i can perhaps read a little bit the user coent if you want or uh yes
[22:30][22:46] mirek : you can read the plot outline on the on the on the projector
[22:30][22:46] mirek : but it's basically deep wonderful and penetrating movie extraordinary uh irony and the p and the psychological drama about american life
[22:47][22:50] denis : yes it's definitely about american life
[21:10][21:10] agnes : yes
[22:49][22:52] agnes : suburban life
[22:52][22:59] denis : it's it's kind of crude the critique but uh on the other way it's quite poetic it's uh yes
[22:56][22:58] agnes : there's a lot of very true things in it
[22:59][23:0] mirek : poetic
[23:00][23:6] denis : yes you know with the the way of filming and
[21:19][21:21] agnes : yes
[23:00][23:6] denis : i don't know i found it pretty
[23:05][23:7] mirek : ok the way of filming perhaps but uh
[23:05][23:8] andrei : i haven't seen it but i would like to see it so
[23:08][23:10] denis : no it's q it's quite in interesting
[22:03][22:6] agnes : yes
[23:13][23:14] denis : so yes
[23:14][23:17] agnes : it's much less dark than the other movies we have on that list
[23:17][23:19] denis : well it depends
[23:17][23:19] andrei : so it's not very violent really
[23:19][23:22] agnes : it's not well it's dark but no
[23:21][23:32] denis : ah no it's it's not violent at all
[23:22][23:23] andrei : ah ok great
[23:33][23:39] agnes : no
[23:21][23:32] denis : but more it's more the cr the cr the critique that is quite crude because all the people in this movie are are uh psychopath in their own way
[23:33][23:39] agnes : but not like violent cutting people to pieces psychopaths they're just everyone has their own issues and
[23:34][23:35] denis : but they are normal people then
[23:35][23:36] andrei : ok yes
[23:38][23:49] andrei : uhhuh
[22:15][22:16] denis : yes
[23:38][23:49] andrei : and what about the well that picture with the the girl and
[23:38][23:49] andrei : do you see naked people in the movie or
[23:46][23:56] denis : actually there is this it's uh uh what a fifty years old man that quit his job and fall in love with the best friend of his daughter
[23:48][23:49] agnes : no
[23:38][23:49] andrei : is it about sex or something like that
[23:48][23:49] agnes : well
[23:54][24:1] agnes : with hi his daughter his like teenage daughter
[23:56][23:57] andrei : ah ok
[23:54][24:1] agnes : so that's the best friend and he fantasises about her and
[22:49][22:52] mirek : yes
[23:59][24:4] andrei : supposedly ok
[24:00][24:5] denis : yes it's it's good movie
[24:05][24:5] andrei : uhhuh
[21:37][21:41] andrei : ok
[22:27][22:27] denis : ok
[24:09][24:14] mirek : and it's my last slide so uh yes yes yes and i think ok why not
[24:10][24:11] denis : you have seen it mirek
[24:15][24:32] mirek : it seems to me that perhaps that schindler ok definitely schindler schindler's list is perhaps more serious topic for sure
[24:15][24:32] mirek : but well it depends it depends what we want
[24:15][24:32] mirek : do we want that people are more like uh relaxed in our in our cinema or are more interested in some particular things
[24:33][24:36] mirek : what do you think i mean what should we how we should uh
[24:38][24:41] mirek : what should be the influence how we are influencing the people in the cinema
[24:44][24:53] denis : i think we w want them to to see movies that they won't see oth otherwise but i'm not sure then it's quite popular the movie we selected so
[24:44][24:46] mirek : what do we want
[24:53][25:9] andrei : yes i think it's a mixture of bringing new things to them but also making them enjoy the show so that they come to our movie club so
[24:53][25:9] andrei : yes i think we shouldn't maybe do very mainstream movies but
[24:53][25:9] andrei : well ok the list here is quite uh
[25:09][25:13] agnes : see i don't know what was mainstream in europe
[23:01][23:1] andrei : yes
[25:09][25:13] agnes : like all of these movies are very mainstream for me
[25:14][25:17] andrei : yes i think also if you look at the nber of votes here
[25:09][25:13] agnes : but
[25:15][25:19] denis : if they are in the top fifty they are quite mainstream but uh
[25:20][25:28] andrei : uh
[25:20][25:28] andrei : yes uh
[25:20][25:28] andrei : regarding denis's table i would say given that this site i don't know if it's mainly american but uh i would say that
[25:27][25:30] agnes : it has other movies but i think it's predominantly
[25:30][25:32] denis : uh i think there is the
[25:30][25:36] andrei : yes i think yes it's english speaking anyway so uh though so
[25:34][25:37] denis : there are chinese movies english movies
[25:37][25:38] andrei : yes but if you look at
[25:37][25:39] agnes : no there's movies from everywhere but
[23:12][23:12] andrei : yes
[25:40][26:3] andrei : but i would say mainstream are the ones that have more than whatever sixty thousand votes
[25:40][26:3] andrei : and you can see some more well confidential films that have like ten thousand twenty thousand like princess mononoke twenty thousand and uh whatever the the kieslowski at eleven thousand the trois coleurs rouge
[26:03][26:7] denis : it's it's quite a lot for kieslowski actually
[26:03][26:7] denis : i was surprised to see
[26:05][26:12] andrei : yes it's not bad at all yes
[26:03][26:7] denis : yes yes
[26:05][26:12] andrei : so yes anyway if you want a definition of mainstream or whatever
[23:38][23:39] agnes : yes
[26:12][26:22] denis : and festen also is uh is quite high
[26:12][26:22] denis : uh i i don't know if you've seen this one
[23:58][23:59] andrei : yes
[26:17][26:19] agnes : no i've never even heard of it
[26:12][26:22] denis : it's the celebration i think
[26:12][26:22] denis : it's uh uh movie from a swedish guy
[26:21][26:26] andrei : d uh danish i think it's the dogma movement
[26:24][26:28] denis : danish
[26:24][26:28] denis : dogma movies yes
[25:10][25:10] andrei : yes
[26:24][26:28] denis : lars von trier
[25:40][26:3] andrei : yes
[26:29][26:29] agnes : oh ok
[26:11][26:12] denis : yes
[26:11][26:12] denis : ok can we discuss about your docent maybe
[26:33][26:34] andrei : yes let's uh
[26:15][26:16] andrei : yes
[26:35][26:50] andrei : so it's uh
[26:38][26:41] mirek : maybe can i ask you for the for the list of movies
[26:35][26:50] andrei : actually i have made i have made photocopies
[26:21][26:26] denis : yes
[26:35][26:50] andrei : i have them denis so it's all for you
[26:41][26:42] denis : ok
[26:42][26:43] denis : ok
[26:35][26:50] andrei : actually i i tried to propose just one movie with some alternates
[26:46][26:47] agnes : thank you
[26:48][26:49] mirek : this one and the
[26:35][26:50] andrei : you want one
[26:50][26:57] mirek : denis denis could you give me the the list of the to uh top fifty yes
[26:53][26:53] denis : yes sure
[26:50][26:57] mirek : but you have your own copy then
[26:28][26:29] denis : yes
[26:50][26:57] mirek : ok good thank you
[26:58][27:41] andrei : so my proposal which is only a proposal would be to to keep the focus on uh more or less history and action
[26:58][27:41] andrei : so lawrence of arabia was ok about this guy during the first world war so
[26:58][27:41] andrei : it happens ok outside europe and the states but uh it's a piece of history
[26:58][27:41] andrei : uh apocalypse now it's uh vietnam if i'm correct
[26:58][27:41] andrei : and ok amadeus that's much uh much earlier and it's not about
[26:58][27:41] andrei : it's not violent which is a nice thing i think
[26:58][27:41] andrei : but given that we would like a movie from the nineties i thought the saving private ryan
[26:58][27:41] andrei : oh thanks for projecting the docent
[27:41][28:9] andrei : would keep this more or less this theme of uh history and war and action drama while showing actually a very new and i would say hanistic view on on war
[27:41][28:9] andrei : because it's it's not like the sort of glorification of uh you know the good guys that that uh well go against the nazis but uh it's uh it's
[27:41][28:9] andrei : well the plot actually if you don't know it
[28:09][28:35] andrei : it's about people looking for just one soldier in fact
[28:09][28:35] andrei : it's it's about a a family of four brothers who
[28:09][28:35] andrei : actually three of them get killed during the war in these days of forty well i guess suer forty four
[28:09][28:35] andrei : and the uh well the government decides that they need to get back the fourth brother just to save one member of the family
[28:09][28:35] andrei : and this this guy is private ryan
[28:35][29:6] andrei : so the movie is not about killing the germans or whatever
[28:35][29:6] andrei : it's about saving at least one guy from a family so
[28:35][29:6] andrei : but of course the the setting is during the war and it's very realistic and uh very dramatic in fact
[28:35][29:6] andrei : it's it's not at all a glorification of war but it's just uh
[28:35][29:6] andrei : it shows a bit uh the violence of of the things
[28:35][29:6] andrei : and especially the the beginning is uh i think it's great it's it's very violent but it's it's an image of of war it's uh
[26:29][26:29] denis : yes
[29:05][29:9] agnes : it's v very very violent
[29:04][29:7] denis : it's quite horrible actually
[29:09][29:13] andrei : yes but i think if well if you compare it with
[26:35][26:50] denis : yes
[29:11][29:13] denis : mirek you didn't see it
[29:12][29:19] mirek : that's the i i i saw it and i d i'm trying to remember the beginning that's the normandy landing
[29:15][29:17] agnes : the landing yes
[29:15][29:21] andrei : it yes it's the landing and actually every more or less everyone gets killed and
[29:12][29:19] mirek : ok yes yes yes yes yes that was really horrible
[26:39][26:39] denis : yes
[26:55][26:56] agnes : yes
[29:18][29:22] agnes : this is not a movie for kids like
[29:19][29:25] denis : but it's it's a piece of art because he used something like one hundred camera to film that or
[29:04][29:7] mirek : yes
[29:25][29:57] andrei : oh i i didn't know
[29:25][29:57] andrei : but yes actually it's very well filmed and it's very realistic
[29:09][29:9] agnes : yes
[29:16][29:17] denis : yes
[29:25][29:57] andrei : and i don't know if you compare with i don't know in lawrence of arabia i think they have some battles and camels i know it's very nice someone falls somewhere there and well you know it's like battles that look nice
[29:35][29:36] denis : yes it's quite s yes
[29:25][29:57] andrei : but this one doesn't look nice
[29:42][29:44] mirek : no not at all
[29:25][29:57] andrei : and i think it's uh it's also maybe representative of the nineties
[29:25][29:57] andrei : you know people starting to get the more uh realistic view of uh of of war
[29:25][29:57] andrei : but it's true it's it's a bit violent and so what i put here
[29:25][29:57] andrei : it's a bit long too it's nearly three hours
[29:58][30:2] andrei : but uh i don't know apocalypse now is quite long too i think
[29:18][29:22] agnes : yes
[30:02][30:9] denis : yes it is
[30:02][30:9] denis : there is two there are two versions i think and but w but we yes we projected the longer one so
[30:03][30:4] andrei : i don't remember
[30:05][30:7] agnes : yes the redux version is longer
[29:21][29:22] agnes : yes
[29:26][29:27] andrei : yes
[30:09][30:21] andrei : so it won uh five oscar prizes uh best director for steven spielberg
[30:09][30:21] andrei : best cimena cinematography etcetera uh
[30:20][30:26] denis : how many times uh spielberg received the best uh director oscar
[30:25][30:27] agnes : i think just once for this
[25:20][25:28] andrei : i don't know
[30:27][30:29] denis : not for the schin schindler's list or for
[30:29][30:30] agnes : oh maybe he did
[30:30][30:31] denis : for e_t_
[30:31][30:40] agnes : no for e_t_ he didn't
[30:33][30:35] denis : he won f he won the
[30:31][30:40] agnes : it wasn't until he started doing things like schindler's list and saving private ryan that he actually started winning awards for them
[30:34][30:34] andrei : oh
[30:40][30:44] denis : no he won f for e_t_ he won the cannes uh what is uh palme d'or
[30:41][30:42] agnes : did he
[30:44][30:45] agnes : oh ok yes
[29:28][29:28] denis : yes
[30:47][30:48] agnes : i didn't know that
[26:32][26:33] andrei : ok
[30:49][31:10] andrei : so yes that's that's the point it's it's a bit grey
[30:49][31:10] andrei : and actually if you look at my second page
[30:49][31:10] andrei : uh in the trivia i found out that in fact they uh actually reduced the the colour saturation of the movie
[30:49][31:10] andrei : just to make it look maybe a bit like the docentaries from the time
[31:05][31:7] denis : that was very interesting to read yes
[30:49][31:10] andrei : yes i was very surprised to find this uh it's
[31:09][31:16] denis : but then they uh i read that they they
[31:13][31:16] andrei : they they turned back the colours for uh
[31:09][31:16] denis : w where was it
[31:14][31:16] agnes : they reenhanced the colour yes
[31:09][31:16] denis : th they turned back to yes
[31:16][31:25] mirek : because people start to complain that uh that w there was a problem with a t_v_ when they were broadcasting the movie on the t_v_ uh
[30:01][30:3] andrei : yes
[31:18][31:20] agnes : that it was their t_v_s and not
[30:09][30:9] andrei : yes
[31:23][31:48] andrei : so this uh fact nber two i think obviously for i mean technical people like us is uh is is is quite funny
[31:26][31:29] mirek : that's an interesting point interesting point
[31:23][31:48] andrei : so yes so i i mean these four points could serve also as an introduction if you want to talk f fo for fi five or ten minutes before the movie i don't know in in the room
[31:23][31:48] andrei : so uh yes so tha this would be my candidate but i'm very much open to
[31:46][32:10] denis : and then then there is this uh there is an hero i mean it's uh or a nonhero and in all the other stu stories the in the previous movies there were an he an hero lawrence of arabia uh amadeus
[31:46][32:10] denis : apocalypse now it's also nonhero i think but uh but here i don't remember it's actually the tom hanks the hero or it's
[30:09][30:21] agnes : yes
[32:07][32:20] andrei : yes on th on yes on the picture actually yes it's tom hanks
[32:07][32:20] andrei : in fact you you don't see uh private ryan until the end more or less or you see because they they're looking for him
[32:17][32:25] agnes : yes about two thirds of the way through the movie 'cause most of the movie is them find trying to find him on the front right
[32:18][32:21] mirek : yes but in the end you can ref yes
[30:45][30:46] andrei : yes
[32:23][32:27] denis : he's private ryan tom hanks
[32:17][32:25] agnes : no no
[32:25][32:26] andrei : no tom tom
[32:23][32:27] denis : no he's not
[32:23][32:27] mirek : no
[32:23][32:27] denis : he's trying to find him
[32:26][32:27] agnes : yes he's trying to find him
[31:17][31:17] andrei : yes
[32:27][32:30] andrei : well the caption says captain john miller so
[32:31][32:36] andrei : so i if you look at the caption
[32:31][32:32] denis : yes yes
[31:23][31:48] andrei : yes
[26:41][26:42] denis : ok
[32:31][32:36] andrei : so he's uh he's
[32:35][32:38] agnes : private ryan was matt damon i think yes
[32:04][32:4] andrei : yes
[32:37][32:41] andrei : so the private is just a simple soldier actually yes
[32:07][32:20] agnes : yes
[32:40][32:45] mirek : by the way did he fied dinally uh f fi died finally or not
[32:45][32:52] andrei : uh who private ryan or
[32:46][32:47] mirek : uh the private ryan yes
[32:45][32:52] andrei : no no they find him actually and they send him back to the family but the captain dies actually tom han
[32:48][32:53] mirek : th they i remember i remember they found him but
[32:27][32:30] agnes : yes
[32:48][32:53] mirek : ah ok yes yes yes
[32:51][32:57] agnes : is it him at the begin it's him at the beginning of the movie at the at the the graveyard right
[2:30][2:35] andrei : l
[32:57][32:58] mirek : because i remember
[32:58][33:1] andrei : oh yes it's private ryan yes remembering at the beginning
[32:59][33:2] agnes : yes with his family yes
[33:01][33:12] mirek : because i remember that th in the end of the movie they are trying to defend some bridge or something and there's quite heavy shooting and uh finally it's actually john miller who die
[33:11][33:16] andrei : yes exactly yes he dies unfortunately
[33:01][33:12] mirek : ok ok
[2:38][2:41] andrei : so yes there is sacrifice and
[33:15][33:16] mirek : it's not the private ryan
[33:15][33:33] denis : at the end to tell you the truth i didn't like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic because there were a guy who was who didn't kill german because he was quite nonviolent
[33:15][33:33] denis : and because he didn't kill this german the german killed i don't know uh maybe
[33:32][33:33] andrei : oh
[33:33][33:35] mirek : perhaps it was a g uh this uh tom hanks yes
[32:31][32:36] denis : yes
[33:37][33:38] mirek : oh yes yes
[33:37][33:40] denis : and it was like if he had killed the
[33:40][33:41] andrei : yes the german
[33:41][33:46] mirek : if he would kill him he wouldn't die wow tom hanks wouldn't die
[33:43][33:45] andrei : uhhuh yes
[33:43][33:44] denis : because he e yes
[33:46][34:2] andrei : well i mean yes it has a moral dimension all over the movie you know saving the individual and the guys
[32:37][32:41] denis : yes
[33:46][34:2] andrei : so yes i i don't know i don't know how many people have have seen it
[33:46][34:2] andrei : well among you well most of you actually
[33:57][33:58] agnes : i have
[33:58][33:59] denis : i have
[33:58][33:59] mirek : i've seen it i've seen it
[33:46][34:2] andrei : oh all ok all of us
[33:46][34:2] andrei : so maybe th people know it quite well
[32:40][32:41] denis : yes
[34:02][34:4] denis : yes we're running
[32:49][32:50] andrei : yes
[34:04][34:5] mirek : out of time
[34:03][34:24] andrei : ok so yes so i have some other candidates
[34:03][34:24] andrei : it's on first page at the bottom
[34:03][34:24] andrei : uh i also put pulp fiction uh the silence of the lambs and i also well sort of included ^la vita e bella^
[34:03][34:24] andrei : but i know we're an engish movie club so i guess it's it's a bit out of purpose
[34:23][34:25] mirek : what is the movie about the ^la vita e bella^
[21:11][21:17] andrei : but it
[34:26][34:52] andrei : oh it's uh it's about again about the camps and the second world war
[34:27][34:29] denis : but it was in english no
[34:30][34:31] mirek : ahha
[34:26][34:52] andrei : so it's about uh a family of italians which uh g arrives into a a death camp
[34:30][34:32] agnes : i don't think so no it was an italian
[34:36][34:36] mirek : uhhuh
[34:26][34:52] andrei : and in fact it's treated in a more or less horous mode
[34:26][34:52] andrei : so the father tries to hide from i from his boy that they are in a death camp
[34:45][34:47] mirek : uhhuh uhhuh
[34:26][34:52] andrei : and it's this very strange well not really hour but relation between the uh how
[34:51][34:54] mirek : how it end up what is the what is the ending of the movie
[34:53][35:10] andrei : well the boy gets saved but the father dies
[34:53][35:10] andrei : yes so i don't know
[34:53][35:10] andrei : i it created some controversies i think because people said you shouldn't do any form of hour related to the camps
[34:53][35:10] andrei : but it's very very moving so i think it's anyway italian so
[35:10][35:17] mirek : that's actually the third movie about the second war schindler's list a p uh saving private ryan and ^la vita e bella^
[33:11][33:16] agnes : yes
[35:16][35:17] andrei : yes yes
[35:18][35:21] andrei : ok uh denis
[35:21][35:36] denis : yes so i have uh a quite different movie to propose you
[35:21][35:36] denis : i don't know uh it's f called the big lebowski from uh joel coen
[35:21][35:36] denis : actually they are brothers you probably know them
[35:21][35:36] denis : i don't know how many of you have seen this movie
[35:36][35:38] agnes : no
[35:38][35:44] andrei : haven't seen it but uh i heard it's very funny
[35:44][35:47] denis : no
[35:38][35:39] mirek : just partially i think
[35:38][35:44] andrei : and i've seen some other films by by the coen brothers
[35:44][35:47] denis : yes they made uh fargo which is in the list
[35:46][35:48] andrei : yes which is in your table
[35:48][35:49] denis : and uh
[35:50][35:54] andrei : the last one was the one with catherine zetajones uh
[35:53][35:59] denis : uh cr uh cruel intentions or something like that i think or
[35:56][35:57] andrei : crue crue
[35:59][36:2] andrei : yes something about cruelty or very funny
[36:01][36:15] denis : ok so i don't know how i'm going to sell you this movie because actually the plot is impossible to make because it's actually it's inspired from a movie called the big sleep and
[36:16][36:17] andrei : a movie or a novel
[36:18][36:28] denis : uh it's actually the t where i've seen that
[36:18][36:28] denis : in a it's uh a movie from raymond chandler the big sleep
[36:18][36:28] denis : it's uh
[36:27][36:35] andrei : no but they say that raymond chandler wrote the novel
[36:31][36:32] denis : ah ok
[36:27][36:35] andrei : you see it's the the last but one paragraph on your second page
[36:34][36:36] denis : yes yes yes
[36:34][36:36] denis : so it's it's uh it's a novel ok
[36:34][36:36] denis : but uh then the story goes that while that film was in production and director howard hawks
[36:39][36:40] andrei : i think so
[36:38][37:23] denis : ok ok you're right it was a book
[2:38][2:41] denis : ok so it's about a a g a guy wh called the d the dude i don't know you pronounce it
[36:38][37:23] denis : and uh he's actually uh smoking pot and doing nothing just he's living in l_a_
[36:38][37:23] denis : it's uh it's a typical typical fellow from the from the suburb
[36:38][37:23] denis : and he has some friends uh typical friends
[36:38][37:23] denis : one one is uh an old guy from coming back from vietnam obsessed by vietnam
[36:38][37:23] denis : another guy who is never speaking
[36:38][37:23] denis : and they all play together uh bowling
[36:38][37:23] denis : and
[37:23][37:39] denis : the casting is very interesting there is
[37:23][37:39] denis : ok actually i wanted to propose you some posters related to this movie
[37:23][37:39] denis : uh maybe it w maybe it's going to open the discussion on on posters as well
[37:40][38:1] denis : so actually here you on this the first poster you can see the actors from the movie
[37:40][38:1] denis : i don't know if you know some of them
[37:40][38:1] denis : so jeff bridges at the top uh goodman is the second one the b the big guy then turturro and uh uh the last one is buscemi and i don't remember the name of the girl
[38:01][38:4] agnes : it's julianne moore isn't it yes
[38:03][38:4] denis : yes julianne moore
[38:04][38:7] andrei : y you wrote the paragraph on the poster
[38:07][38:12] denis : uh i i took it from i don't know where so uh
[26:43][26:43] andrei : ok
[38:11][38:15] andrei : could be edited a bit
[38:13][38:13] denis : actu
[38:15][38:32] denis : actually i'm not going to sp to describe much more the big lebowski but uh it's quite hard to describe it's uh it's it's a journey about this guy
[38:15][38:32] denis : but it's it's a movie quite surrealistic i mean there are some part that are like coming from dreams and uh
[38:30][38:37] mirek : why the movie is called the big lebowski why the big
[38:30][38:37] mirek : uh lebowski is his uh family name right
[38:30][38:37] mirek : but why it's called the big
[38:36][38:46] denis : yes it's his family name and uh actually jeffrey lebowski and he's he's the
[38:36][38:46] denis : there is a a story with another lebowski that yes
[38:44][38:46] andrei : yes yes there are two lebowskis in the film
[38:46][38:51] mirek : ok
[38:46][38:51] mirek : and why the big lebowski
[38:47][38:48] denis : and uh
[38:46][38:51] mirek : it's the it's the second one or
[38:49][38:57] denis : i i i don't remember maybe it's just uh uh because of the big sleep there is uh
[38:56][38:58] mirek : uhhuh
[38:56][38:58] mirek : ah ok ok uhhuh
[38:57][38:59] andrei : yes there should be a reference there
[38:57][39:23] denis : i don't know a reference
[38:57][39:23] denis : so it's a kind of it's like american beauty in some way it's even worse
[33:35][33:35] andrei : yes
[38:57][39:23] denis : we see worse people
[38:57][39:23] denis : so it's kind of uh an ethnographic movie i would say but uh and it's a modern hero it's it's quite fun
[38:57][39:23] denis : and the casting is is marvellous
[38:57][39:23] denis : so that is that's it for this movie
[38:57][39:23] denis : and i just wanted to go to the design of the poster actually
[39:24][39:25] agnes : i quite like that
[38:57][39:23] denis : because
[39:26][39:30] andrei : yes it's probably a bit dark for a poster but otherwise it's very nice
[33:50][33:50] denis : yes
[34:00][34:1] denis : yes
[39:30][39:40] denis : the idea is is also to discuss the content
[39:30][39:40] denis : shall we put a suary of the movie or the plot
[39:30][39:40] denis : and w what kind of information do we want
[39:30][39:40] denis : so that's the first poster
[39:30][39:40] denis : there is also this poster quite dark also
[39:47][40:4] denis : uh so y y i don't know if you you cannot really see but uh there is the the pricing information
[39:47][40:4] denis : so we said that one movie is eight francs and three movies eighteen francs and we can have annual subscrip subscription of sixty francs
[34:03][34:24] agnes : yes
[40:06][40:12] denis : uh i wanted to say some information to involve people on in the committee as well if they want to take part to the committee to select movies
[35:13][35:14] agnes : yes
[40:14][40:16] denis : and uh what else
[40:14][40:16] denis : s some
[40:17][40:31] mirek : i think this is not bad because they say something little bit about our uh movie club
[40:17][40:31] mirek : and uh yes the big lebowski it's clear that it's a movie and uh
[40:17][40:31] mirek : i guess the people can remember that it was a movie at least even if they haven't see it
[40:31][40:36] agnes : looks like a c_d_ cover
[40:34][40:35] mirek : cd cover
[40:34][40:41] denis : yes actually the idea was to s yes there is at the bottom the a scene from one of these dream of the big lebowski
[40:31][40:36] agnes : yes
[40:41][40:42] andrei : oh ok it's a dream
[40:42][41:3] denis : and uh the the first part is actually y you see a cowboy and the the hero the jeffrey lebowski the dude
[40:42][41:3] denis : and the cowboy it's actually at the beginning of the movie the c the cowboy introduces the story and he's coming back at the end of the story and he's e explaining what kind of movie uh you are going to to see
[40:57][40:58] agnes : oh ok
[41:02][41:5] andrei : ok sounds a bit crazy
[41:06][41:8] denis : and last posters
[41:13][41:14] andrei : yes
[41:13][41:23] denis : so same principle but i w i don't know i w i was thinking of adding some some cita quotations of uh well known directors
[41:13][41:14] andrei : uhhuh
[41:13][41:14] andrei : yes
[41:24][41:25] denis : and uh
[41:24][41:29] andrei : i like it because it's not so dark so the images are a bit brighter
[41:29][41:35] mirek : yes but i on the contrary i would say there is too many colours and uh it's difficult to read and uh
[41:29][41:35] agnes : i actually don't like it
[41:29][41:35] agnes : it looks like two yes
[41:29][41:35] agnes : it's it looks like two separate posters
[41:37][41:44] agnes : although i think you can mix
[41:37][41:38] andrei : yes yes
[41:37][41:44] agnes : i would keep the format of the first one add the quotes and the content information from the second one
[40:03][40:4] andrei : yes
[41:45][41:46] mirek : yes that would be the best
[41:47][42:4] agnes : so take those take those quotes
[41:47][42:4] agnes : get rid of that section of text
[41:50][41:51] mirek : %
[40:11][40:12] andrei : yes
[40:41][40:41] denis : yes
[41:47][42:4] agnes : put those quotes in there
[40:41][40:41] denis : ok
[41:47][42:4] agnes : put the the information you had in the second poster about the movie club how to join kind of in the middle
[42:04][42:5] denis : ok
[41:47][42:4] agnes : and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up
[42:04][42:5] denis : ok i see
[42:06][42:15] andrei : wh what about a brighter background because this one i don't know how it would show on a wall or something like this
[42:06][42:15] andrei : it doesn't really catch your attention
[42:16][42:25] agnes : i think it does
[42:17][42:18] andrei : 'kay
[42:17][42:18] denis : and yes
[42:16][42:25] agnes : i think the contrast between the the the strip of film and or the strip of pictures and everything else is
[41:07][41:8] andrei : yes
[42:26][42:28] andrei : yes ok
[42:27][42:33] denis : ok i see
[42:27][42:33] denis : what i wanted is more or less to know the content of the movie uh what y you want to have on the poster
[42:31][42:32] mirek : %
[41:19][41:20] agnes : yes
[42:34][42:37] andrei : yes no the content was very good in the second one th
[42:34][42:36] denis : because we di we
[42:37][42:39] denis : ok on that one
[42:39][42:51] agnes : yes so take all of that content
[42:40][42:42] andrei : yes all this information is very good
[42:41][42:43] mirek : yes all this information and put into the first one
[42:39][42:51] agnes : throw it up into the first one
[42:39][42:51] agnes : and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the from the famous directors sort of at the bottom or something
[42:53][42:58] denis : ok
[42:49][42:51] andrei : oh or just one of them
[42:50][42:53] mirek : if if they fit there if they fit there you will see
[41:44][41:45] agnes : yes
[42:53][42:58] denis : ok great
[42:53][42:58] denis : so i think now we have to decide for a movie
[42:58][42:59] mirek : %
[41:51][41:52] denis : and
[43:01][43:3] andrei : oh yes w
[41:51][41:52] denis : yes
[41:51][41:52] denis : so

[43:06][43:7] mirek : so big lebowski
[43:07][43:12] andrei : if it's not too long maybe each of us could nominate one or two movies
[43:07][43:12] andrei : we make a list and then we vote
[43:12][43:14] mirek : ok good idea
[43:15][43:15] andrei : what do you think

[43:34][43:36] andrei : ok agnes usual suspects
[43:36][43:44] agnes : mainly because only two of us have seen it and it's not a mainstream movie

[41:52][41:52] andrei : yes
