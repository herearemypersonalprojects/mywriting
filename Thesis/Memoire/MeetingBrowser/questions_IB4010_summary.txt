andrei Um 
andrei 5363 woods 5364 keep this 5366 more or 5368 less this 5370 team of um 
andrei 5373 history and 5375 warren 5376 action 5377 drama 
andrei 5378 actually am very 5381 new and i 5384 would 5385 say 5386 if you 5388 monastic 5389 view on on 5392 more 
andrei 5393 Because it it 5396 not 5397 like the um 
andrei 5400 sort of 5402 glorification of uh you 5406 know the 5408 good 5409 guys that that uh well 5414 go 5415 against the 5417 nazis 
andrei But it uh 
andrei it uh it well the 5426 plot 5427 actually 5428 if you do 5431 not 5432 know it It about 5436 people are 5438 looking for 5440 just one 5442 soldier in 5444 fact it a um it about a a 5452 family of 5454 four 5455 brothers 5456 two 
andrei 5457 Actually 5458 three of them 5461 get 5462 killed 5463 during the 5465 war in these 5468 days to 5470 forty what i 5473 guess 5474 summer 5475 forty 5476 four 
andrei And uh 
andrei well the 5481 government 5482 decides that they 5485 need to 5487 get 5488 back to 5490 force 5491 brother 5492 Just to 5494 save one 5496 number of the 5499 family and this this 5503 guy 5504 private 5505 ryan 
andrei So the 5508 movies 5509 not about to 5512 killing 5513 detriments or 5515 whatever it about 5518 saving at 5520 least one 5522 guy 5523 from a 5525 family 
andrei So but of 5529 course the the 5532 setting 5533 use 5534 during the 5536 war and um 
andrei it a 5541 realistic and uh very 5545 dramatic in 5547 fact it so um 
andrei It 5552 not 5553 all of 5555 glorification of 5557 war but it 5560 just a It 5563 shows a 5565 bit that the 5568 violence of um 
andrei Of the 5573 things and 5575 especially the the 5578 beginning is uh
