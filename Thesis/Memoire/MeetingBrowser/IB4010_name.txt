	Episode #1 (keywords: agenda)
► ■ Andrei 	Hi.
► ■ Denis 	Hi.
► ■ Mirek 	Hello. $
► ■ Agnes 	Hello.
► ■ Andrei 	Hi everyone.
► ■ Denis 	So I don't know if you all received the the a- agenda for this meeting.
► ■ Denis 	Do you - no?
► ■ Mirek 	No, I haven't.
► ■ Denis 	Here it is.
► ■ Mirek 	Thank you.
► ■ Andrei 	I haven't.
► ■ Denis 	So um um the goal for today are um -
► ■ Denis 	We have two goals. Uh -
► ■ Denis 	First is to decide a movie for uh the next projection for our movie club.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	As you know - uh so it's for the last Friday of this month of April.
► ■ Denis 	As you probably remember, the movie already projected were uh Lawrence of Arabia and Apocalypse Now in February and Amadeus from Milos Forman in March.
► ■ Denis 	So um the question that is open is
► ■ Denis 	are we going to select a movie from the nineties and which movie.
► ■ Denis 	So that's the first goal, decide for a movie to be projected,
► ■ Denis 	and second goal is to uh discuss for an ad- advertising poster um for our um uh club,
► ■ Denis 	because we noticed that n- last time not enough people came to the projection.
► ■ Denis 	So that's it. Um -
	Episode #2 (keywords: presentation, start)
► ■ Denis 	Wh- who wants to start to -
► ■ Denis 	So I guess you all prepared some documents for the mm selection of movie.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yes.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Agnes 	Yep.
► ■ Andrei 	So who who has what actually maybe
► ■ Agnes 	Um I've got a PowerPoint presentation.
► ■ Andrei 	um -
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh-huh.
► ■ Andrei 	What do you have, Mirek?
► ■ Mirek 	Okay, I have a PowerPoint presentation
► ■ Mirek 	and uh it's about -
► ■ Mirek 	there are some reviews of the of the I think, like, seven movies.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh-huh.
► ■ Andrei 	And I have a uh well just a a piece of paper with some suggestions.
► ■ Andrei 	What about you, Denis?
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, I have also uh a piece of paper with uh my favourite movie.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh-huh.
► ■ Denis 	Okay, so
► ■ Andrei 	should we start with the two presentations maybe?
► ■ Denis 	Presentation? Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah?
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Denis 	A-
► ■ Denis 	Agnes, we can start with you?
► ■ Agnes 	Sure.
► ■ Agnes 	It's not very long in any case.
► ■ Denis 	Okay, here it is.
► ■ Agnes 	Yep.
► ■ Denis 	I pass this one ?
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah. $
	Episode #3 (keywords: Agnes, movies)
► ■ Agnes 	Okay so
► ■ Agnes 	what I was thinking is basically the previous movies that we had, which you've already mentioned in the agenda d- um Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now and Amadeus, were fairly historical, serious, dramatic, and also action-ey* movies except for maybe Amadeus.
► ■ Agnes 	Um this month I was thinking of selecting something that's more in the present time, still dramatic but slightly less serious.
► ■ Agnes 	And what I'd propose is something of a thriller or mystery.
► ■ Agnes 	And I know that a lot of people find mystery is not really mysterious* in the movies these days, they kind of can predict what's gonna happen, um but in the nineties there were some movies that did have surprise endings and that people came out saying okay, didn't see that coming.
► ■ Agnes 	So I thought we could maybe show one of those.
► ■ Agnes 	And even if people have already seen the movie, a lot of the times you go back and watch the movie again, and you pick up on things that you didn't really notice the first time around, or you see where the clues were and mm what led up to the end.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	So that's more along the lines of what I was thinking.
► ■ Agnes 	And the two in particular that I would propose are,
► ■ Agnes 	next slide please
► ■ Agnes 	The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense.
► ■ Agnes 	Um I don't know if you've seen any of them.
► ■ Agnes 	Uh The Usual Suspects was directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie.
► ■ Agnes 	It has a fairly large cast, so I'm not gonna read all of them, but the main characters are Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne.
► ■ Agnes 	And it's basically about five criminals who get set up.
► ■ Agnes 	Um they're arrested, they're released from prison and the get together um and plan a crime, and basically the story is told through the views of one of the suspects.
► ■ Agnes 	Um the tag line is kind of neat, five criminals, one lineup, no coincidence and you get told the story um as uh - that these f- characters are being controlled um by one sort of uber-villain, and in the end you find who the uber-villain was.
► ■ Agnes 	And I kind of like the the quote from Rolling Stone magazine, The Usual Suspects is the freshest, funniest -
► ■ Denis 	Which which one was it again?
► ■ Denis 	The guy who was controlling?
► ■ Denis 	I don't remember, I have seen the movie twice, but uh -
► ■ Agnes 	Well they ha-
► ■ Agnes 	Have you guys seen the movie?
► ■ Andrei 	No, I haven't seen it.
► ■ Mirek 	No, I haven't.
► ■ Denis 	It's the bald guy, the -
► ■ Agnes 	So I'm not gonna give away -
► ■ Agnes 	You want me to give away the movie?
► ■ Denis 	No, no.
► ■ Agnes 	That'll spoil it.
► ■ Denis 	Okay. $
► ■ Agnes 	I'll tell you later.
► ■ Agnes 	But the the quote from Rolling Stone is fairly accurate, I think. It's one of the freshest, funniest and scariest crime thrillers to come along since Pulp Fiction.
► ■ Agnes 	And the other movie is The Sixth Sense with the famous line I see dead people, which the little boy says.
► ■ Agnes 	Um it was written and directed by M_ Night uh Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette and again has a neat twist that you find out right at the end.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, it's a bit more commercial that one the first one.
► ■ Andrei 	Um.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	yeah, The Sixth Sense was very commercial, but
► ■ Agnes 	anyways -
► ■ Andrei 	So w- what what is this s- the second image on the slide?
► ■ Andrei 	Is it the the poster or -
► ■ Agnes 	It's the poster for The Sixth Sense, but unfortunately I couldn't find a clear, big enough one.
► ■ Andrei 	Has a s- it has a strange format, um horizontal and -
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, I th- I think it's only part of a full - yeah, it goes th- the all of the se- all of the senses.
► ■ Andrei 	oh so it's one two three four five six.
► ■ Agnes 	Um if you go to the next slide there's slightly more detailed things about the movies.
	Episode #4 (keywords: Agnes, Usual Suspects)
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	So The Usual Suspects is a hundred and five minutes long, so it's a decent length of time.
► ■ Agnes 	It has an R_ rating, so I don't remember what type of audience we had at the last .. uh shows, but it may not necessarily be suitable for kids.
► ■ Denis 	Um -
► ■ Denis 	R_ is what uh in -
► ■ Agnes 	R_ is sort of if you're eighteen and under, you have to have an adult with you.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	So it means restricted. Uh-huh.
► ■ Mirek 	Hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	It's mostly for violence, yeah, it's restricted.
► ■ Denis 	Restricted.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Um it got an eight point seven out of ten on the Internet Movie Database.
► ■ Agnes 	It's the sixteenth in the top f- two hundred and fifty movies and fourth in the top movies of the nineties.
► ■ Agnes 	It won um a couple of Academy Awards, notably for best writing, um so that's for the script um and best actor for Kevin Spacey.
► ■ Denis 	But wait, I -
► ■ Denis 	I have the top ten from the nineties?
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	No, the top fifty.
► ■ Denis 	And it's fourth.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, fourth in the top movies of the nineties.
► ■ Denis 	Oh, sorry, sorry, yep. Yeah, yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty I think, of all time.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, because your table is only the nineties, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	From - yeah. Yeah, yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Nineties, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	So it won lots of awards um, it won best film from the British um British Film Association, the British equivalent of the Academy Awards.
► ■ Agnes 	Um it was nominated for best foreign film for the Cesar.
► ■ Mirek 	So plenty of awards we we could say. $
► ■ Denis 	But but sixteenth in top two hundred fifty, it's what two uh - all all days?
► ■ Agnes 	Plenty of awards, yeah. $
► ■ Andrei 	Well -
► ■ Agnes 	I think of all time, yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Of all the movies, yeah yeah.
► ■ Denis 	All times?
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	So
► ■ Mirek 	It's still good, actually. $
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Agnes 	yeah.
	Episode #5 (keywords: ratings)
► ■ Denis 	But those rating are more like uh - it's the number of votes, no?
► ■ Andrei 	W- w-
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, it's ratings by viewers and -
► ■ Denis 	Votes and u-
► ■ Mirek 	By the users.
► ■ Andrei 	No -
► ■ Andrei 	No, actually if you look at your tables,
► ■ Andrei 	I think it's a sort of uh well average between number of votes and and and uh yeah the the rating or th- the marks,
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Denis 	And rating.
► ■ Andrei 	because there are - in your table you have uh things that have very few votes but still are ranked quite high,
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, like Memories -
► ■ Andrei 	for instance number twenty four, which has only four thousand votes
► ■ Denis 	Yeah yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	%
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, and Forty Four as well, which has seven hundred and forty something votes.
► ■ Andrei 	But um - yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	So it's definitely just the average of the rating and -
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Mirek 	okay th- the number of the votes is there just for the information, so that you know how how reliable - yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah
► ■ Andrei 	Maybe it's just the search is compensated a bit for the number of people,
► ■ Mirek 	Yes.
► ■ Andrei 	I I don't know actually.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm -
► ■ Andrei 	Because if you have just ten votes and - yeah probably are not in the database.
► ■ Mirek 	Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	Okay, then you - yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Then yes, yes, yes, yes, sure.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah so -
► ■ Andrei 	But yeah, anyway it has excellent votes.
► ■ Denis 	Okay, yep.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah um -
► ■ Andrei 	Haven't seen it, but - $
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	That's a good movie, I I highly recommend it,
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	and I wouldn't mind seeing it again, because I do know the ending and I haven't been able to watch it again to see where the hints were that were scattered across the movie, 'cause apparently there are hints as to who it is.
► ■ Mirek 	%
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	Ah, now I remember.
► ■ Andrei 	Oh.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah. Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah. $
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Denis 	Actually there is one guy who is the - at the police station and they ask him to tell the story. Yeah. Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	and he's the one telling the story, yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	There's him and the the guy in the burn unit.
► ■ Andrei 	Yep. $
	Episode #6 (keywords: Agnes, Sixth Sense)
► ■ Mirek 	And what is the second movie?
► ■ Agnes 	The second movie is The Sixth Sense.
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah, Sixth Sen-
► ■ Agnes 	Again, it's fairly short.
► ■ Agnes 	It has an easier rating, it's P_G_ thirteen, um it's much less violent.
► ■ Agnes 	It got an eight point one out of ten, it's a hundred and first in the top two hundred and fifty and it's nineteenth on your list I think, if I'm not mistaken.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, it's nineteenth.
► ■ Agnes 	Um got a fair number of votes, too, ninety six thousand.
► ■ Agnes 	Um again, it was nominated for a lot of different Academy Awards, um it didn't win any, but it got a lot of buzz and a lot of people liked it, so.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Those are my two selections, and as you can see, the plot is a boy who communicates with spirits that don't know when they're dead, seeks the help of a disheartened* child psychologist to figure out why he's seeing what he's seeing and .. what it means.
► ■ Denis 	Both movies are quite similar in some way, because the last sentence is uh totally contradictory to the whole movie. It's uh -
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	The last sentence from the movie or - oh.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, the last sentence from the movie.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	W-
► ■ Agnes 	It's only right right at the end where you find out really what's going on and it makes you rethink everything that happened beforehand.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	So those would be my two suggestions and y- they ar- they are slightly more commercial, or at leas The Sixth Sense is, than the other ones we've seen, but -
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	So these guys were actually nominated,
► ■ Andrei 	so the the bottom part of your slide, actually,
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	it says - yeah,
► ■ Andrei 	so these are the best awards they had.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, they were they were nominated for a lot of different awards, they didn't win.
► ■ Andrei 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Too bad.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm. $
► ■ Agnes 	But I guess the comp- I can't remember what the competition was that year, but -
► ■ Andrei 	Well there is just one winner, so.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh-huh.
► ■ Agnes 	And they were nominated for a lot of them, and um -
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Agnes 	So I think that's it, unless you have any questions -
► ■ Andrei 	Okay.
► ■ Denis 	You have a last slide or - no?
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, that's it.
	Episode #7 (keywords: Mirek, presentation)
► ■ Mirek 	Okay, now you can go to to my slides,
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	but actually what I pre- what I have prepared is just a kind of a review of fo- uh se- six or seven movies
► ■ Mirek 	if you ca- can go to the second slide.
► ■ Agnes 	You sent your slides around, right?
► ■ Mirek 	Yes, basically seven movies, and it's uh it's uh uh top movies uh based on the uh on the ra- ranking and a- and awards* awards.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Um you see the the names of the movies on the on the on the wall.
► ■ Mirek 	So um we can perhaps go through all of them and we can little bit discuss
► ■ Mirek 	so I I I have n- I didn't see all of them actually,
► ■ Mirek 	so it's just -
► ■ Mirek 	we should probably select one of these, because I think uh these are really good movies and uh, okay, we will see.
► ■ Mirek 	So if you can go through uh okay,
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	so this is the first movie and uh it's it's m- it's more like a drama.
► ■ Mirek 	Uh it's uh it's uh very uh high ranked
► ■ Mirek 	and actually you have a a nicer list, because uh we can even see the number of the votes.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah one hundred f- w- uh one hundred forty thousand.
► ■ Mirek 	So what is the number of the people?
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, I think your table is very clear, Denis.
► ■ Mirek 	Finally I found actually your table much better than my than my presentation, because perhaps here we can we can really see I mean -
► ■ Denis 	No, we don't have the plot of the of the movie and uh -
► ■ Mirek 	What is the ranking?
► ■ Mirek 	We ha- didn't have the plot, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Okay, but maybe we can - wh- who has seen this movie? @
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah, who has seen this movie?
► ■ Agnes 	No I haven't.
► ■ Mirek 	Because then perhaps someone can give some some comment.
► ■ Andrei 	No, I haven't.
► ■ Agnes 	I've heard a lot of good things about it, I've heard it's a really powerful movie, but I haven't seen it.
► ■ Denis 	I uh -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	I think I I I've seen it actually, but -
► ■ Andrei 	W- what is the name in French, 'cause -
► ■ Denis 	I have no idea.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh-huh. Uh yeah.
► ■ Denis 	It it's in uh jail right, it taking - yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, it's set in a jail.
► ■ Denis 	- I don't remember well this movie.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Well, actually your third slide has the plot, so uh.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah, it's this one.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	It's the one that is on the on the wall.
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	It's projected, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Oh yeah, exactly, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Okay. Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	So yeah, this guy is jailed, okay
► ■ Andrei 	uh-huh. Wow.
► ■ Denis 	Okay, so mm -
► ■ Mirek 	So I ge- okay, so no one of us saw this movie, so in that case perhaps it's it's little bit danger to select that movie for the for the
► ■ Andrei 	Okay.
► ■ Denis 	Yep, so let's -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
	Episode #8 (keywords: Mirek, Schindler's List)
► ■ Mirek 	s- play, so uh Schindler's List
► ■ Mirek 	who saw this?
► ■ Agnes 	Me.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, I've seen it also.
► ■ Mirek 	I saw it, and I think this on is re- um this one is really nice
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, I haven't seen - I heard about it, but - $
► ■ Mirek 	it's uh, you know, all a- all of you knows the the story, so.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm. Yep.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Uh it's quite hi- it's quite high ranked
► ■ Mirek 	so I think uh it's not a bad movie
► ■ Mirek 	I'm uh thinking whether there was some good occasion, uh something what has happened recently.
► ■ Mirek 	There was something like a celebration of the .. fifty years after the war or something recently, no?
► ■ Andrei 	Um I think there was a celebration of uh sixty years from the liberation of the camps, actually.
► ■ Denis 	Sixty. S- sixty years.
► ■ Mirek 	No, that's -
► ■ Mirek 	Sixty, yeah. S- it can't be fifty, sure.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Because they were liberated beginning forty five and uh -
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah, so.
► ■ Andrei 	yeah, it's not bad,
► ■ Andrei 	and it's also - I think it's a good idea at at least from my point of view it's coherent with the previous films,
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	like history, im- major events.
► ■ Denis 	Yep. Yep. That's right, yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	That's true.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	I don't know if we want to keep this coherence, or change radically, but maybe -
► ■ Agnes 	It's a fairly emotional movie though.
► ■ Andrei 	yeah, that's - yeah, I think it's a drawback - uhm.
► ■ Agnes 	That's one thing to keep in mind is that it's -
► ■ Denis 	But then it's not - representative of the nineties.
► ■ Denis 	It's more a movie about the story of uh - the horror of the uh - endured by the Jewish during the Second World War.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, but Amadeus isn't really representative of the eighties either.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, right.
► ■ Andrei 	Well, of the seventeen eighties.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, and according to your thing it's nineteen eighty four, so.
► ■ Mirek 	Yes. Yes yes yes.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Maybe it's representative of a style of the eighties, I don't know.
► ■ Andrei 	As for Amadeus, but uh
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	that's - I don't know. But - #
► ■ Mirek 	Um but even here I wouldn't uh uh say that the that th- this style is representative of the nineties, right, so. #
► ■ Agnes 	No.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, hard to tell.
► ■ Mirek 	Um
► ■ Mirek 	okay, but uh anyway, I think it's it's really a good movie, I like it when I saw it and uh - okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	It is a good movie, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Okay, and Steven* Steven Spielberg is uh -
► ■ Mirek 	It's one of the candidates, I defini- yeah
► ■ Mirek 	Steven Spielberg is really quite a good - so I - director
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	so I I would say we we could think about it.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	So I would keep it as a candidate, at least.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	That's the second one.
	Episode #9 (keywords: Mirek, Usual Suspects)
► ■ Denis 	Okay, The Usual Suspect, do we want to say something again about it, or
► ■ Mirek 	Um no.
► ■ Mirek 	I think we can just skip this slide.
► ■ Denis 	How come it's coming third
► ■ Denis 	on your list?
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Uh yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	It's
► ■ Denis 	It's fourth on Agnes's uh and on my list, but it's okay.
► ■ Denis 	Ah you j- you selected some movies, no?
► ■ Denis 	You didn't take the six first.
► ■ Mirek 	That's strange, what is the rating?
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, it's funny actually um
► ■ Mirek 	Perhaps* it has* changed.
► ■ Andrei 	because on your on your slides actually the ratings are eight point seven for both.
► ■ Mirek 	It's higher.
► ■ Andrei 	No they have the same, Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction, both are at eight point seven,
► ■ Andrei 	but on Denis's table uh this one is at eight point six.
► ■ Agnes 	But it gets updated daily.
► ■ Mirek 	It gets updated.
► ■ Andrei 	Who knows, maybe people voted for it, yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Yes, yes, and I did it I did it on Wednesday.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Could have changed in the meanwhile.
► ■ Denis 	And me on Tuesday, probably.
► ■ Andrei 	Though with one hundred and thousand votes, it shouldn't change too much.
► ■ Mirek 	Yes.
► ■ Andrei 	I mean, given the number of votes, I wonder -
► ■ Andrei 	but anyway, it's m- it may change I think, yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm. So it probably has changed, so um
► ■ Andrei 	Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	it becomes* more popular, no po- uh yeah, yeah, yeah. $
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Wow.
► ■ Andrei 	That's encouraging.
► ■ Denis 	Do we have something to add on this movie, or -
► ■ Agnes 	Mm. No.
► ■ Andrei 	No.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Agnes 	Wait, how many of us saw Schindler's List?
► ■ Agnes 	Three of us?
► ■ Agnes 	Did you see it?
► ■ Agnes 	I'm just trying to keep track of how many of us have seen -
► ■ Mirek 	Uh Schindler's List.
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Agnes 	You have?
► ■ Mirek 	I saw it, I saw it.
► ■ Agnes 	You have?
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Agnes 	You haven't.
► ■ Andrei 	Haven't.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh I I've seen very few movies from the list, about ten out of the first fifty.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	%
► ■ Denis 	That's why you are in the movie club, to see more movies. $
► ■ Andrei 	Okay, yeah.
	Episode #10 (keywords: Mirek, Pulp Fiction)
► ■ Mirek 	Okay, Pulp Fiction.
► ■ Mirek 	Uh I think it's again quite uh hi- high ranked uh
► ■ Mirek 	but from my perspective, everyone already saw it.
► ■ Mirek 	Who was interested in that movie, he saw it.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Wh- who is not interested in that movie, he he didn't see it and he uh wouldn't uh like to see it in the in our movie club.
► ■ Mirek 	So I think we should uh we should just leave - skip it out and leave it out.
► ■ Mirek 	I- I wouldn't think about this as a candidate even if it's a good movie, but I don't know, I think it's -
► ■ Denis 	Why not?
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	It's quite representative of the nineties, I think.
► ■ Denis 	And the structure of the movie is interesting.
► ■ Denis 	I I think the the first scene is actually the same scene as the last scene, no?
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	There is a kind of loop in this movie.
► ■ Agnes 	I can't remember.
► ■ Mirek 	Yes, yes, there was ple- I I think there was a plenty of loops actually, plenty of @.
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	I fully agree that you can see this movie three times perhaps, three times and for the fourth time see you still discover something new
► ■ Denis 	Yeah yeah.
► ■ Denis 	I agree also. Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	but uh on the other hand, I have the impression it's really - it's uh, you know, every everyone saw it, it's it's quite well known, uh it woul- it wou- I -
► ■ Denis 	You've you've seen it?
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, I've seen it, this one.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	I I like it very much.
► ■ Agnes 	So we've all seen it.
► ■ Denis 	And the soundtrack is uh is gorgeous also. No ?
► ■ Andrei 	I've actually seen it -
► ■ Agnes 	Is what?
► ■ Denis 	The soundtrack.
► ■ Agnes 	I haven't - I don't remember the soundtrack.

► ■ Mirek 	Mm.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	So what do you think?
► ■ Mirek 	I- I wouldn't think about this as a candidate, because it seems to me it's -
► ■ Andrei 	Oh I would keep it as a candidate, but -
► ■ Andrei 	I don't know, I think for the moment m- m-
► ■ Andrei 	guess most of these are candidates, so we'll try to.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	W- w- we vote at the end, or you want to -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, we should probably vote after everyone -
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, I mean if there's something that none of us like, we can just eliminate it, but we might as well leave everything 'till the end.
► ■ Mirek 	Vote, that's the best, yeah, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah. Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	When going through we c- we could just eliminate.
► ■ Mirek 	Okay, so we are not gonna eliminate this one. $

► ■ Andrei 	Oh okay. $
► ■ Agnes 	I'm a movie buff, I know way too much about movies and actors and everything.
► ■ Andrei 	Huh. Very well.
► ■ Denis 	It's the exact same actors who played in um another mafia movie that I cannot rememb- ^Les Affranchis^, it was the name in French.
► ■ Denis 	No?
► ■ Agnes 	What was it about?
► ■ Denis 	About uh mafia - uh it -
► ■ Agnes 	Very descriptive. $
► ■ Denis 	that's why I tha- that's why I didn't go to see this one,
► ■ Denis 	it's quite - i- it seems to me they're all about the same subject and the same - I don't know.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	And it's a movie from nineties?
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	The one that you saw, that you mentioned?
► ■ Denis 	Probably. Yeah.

	Episode #12 (keywords: Mirek, Silence of the Lambs)
► ■ Mirek 	Silence of the Lambs* uh
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	Should I tell something more?
► ■ Mirek 	Godfather of all thrillers, that's what it what it says on the
► ■ Mirek 	what some uh user says.
► ■ Mirek 	Uh so, okay, it's a little bit horror, so I think it's quite - it's uh it's uh -
► ■ Agnes 	A little bit?
► ■ Mirek 	It's definitely not for kids, uh but uh if the kids are not visitors of our cinema, why not?
► ■ Agnes 	Okay. $
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	It -
► ■ Mirek 	One have to rethink when when when you are watching this movie, you have to think and it's uh scaring.
► ■ Mirek 	Uh why not?
► ■ Denis 	So it's about a psychopathic killer.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm. $
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	And
► ■ Denis 	what was it again, the plot? I mea- the -
► ■ Mirek 	So the F_B_I_ agent is assigned to to help uh find a a missing woman and uh save her f- uh her from a psychopathic killer with the help of another killer.
► ■ Agnes 	So the other killer is Hannibal Lecter, who -
► ■ Andrei 	So -
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Who is in prison, actually.
► ■ Denis 	He - he's in jail and he's still killing?
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, he's in jail and he's real- no, h-
► ■ Mirek 	He's in prison, yes.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	No no.
► ■ Andrei 	He tries to decrypt the the the other killers' behaviour.
► ■ Denis 	Ah, okay, yeah, yeah. #
► ■ Agnes 	He tries to help the F_B_I_ agent, but he plays head games with the F_B_I_ agent at the same time.
► ■ Mirek 	He's a really psychotic man.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah. Well, not very nasty ones.
► ■ Agnes 	And so -
► ■ Andrei 	Or does he, I don't know.
► ■ Agnes 	With her?
► ■ Agnes 	He manages to freak her out.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, that's basically the point, yeah. Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	So.
► ■ Agnes 	Hannibal Lecter is a very -
► ■ Andrei 	So on the picture you can see uh Jodie Foster and uh ha ha.
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Th- th- The moth.
► ■ Agnes 	The moth.
► ■ Denis 	Who's playing the ps- psychopath again?
► ■ Denis 	I don't -
► ■ Agnes 	Which, the one who's in jail or the one who -
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Anthony Hopkins.
► ■ Agnes 	Anthony Hopkins.
► ■ Mirek 	Anthony -
► ■ Denis 	Okay, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	The other one, I don't remember.
► ■ Andrei 	We don't see any h- see him very often.
► ■ Agnes 	I don't either.
► ■ Mirek 	No.
► ■ Mirek 	But he plays it really good.
► ■ Andrei 	But it's -
► ■ Mirek 	Anthony Hop- Hopkins he really plays it very good, very good, yeah. $
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, he's scary in that movie. $
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm. Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	So -
► ■ Andrei 	But the plot is quite horrible.
► ■ Andrei 	I mean the - not the plot, but the - what the the active killer wants to do is quite horrible and -
► ■ Mirek 	%
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, I vaguely remember what it is $, but -
► ■ Andrei 	Mm. $
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Okay.
► ■ Agnes 	How many of us have seen it?
► ■ Agnes 	I'm guessing you haven't seen it or h-
► ■ Denis 	No, I've seen it actually twice, I think. $
► ■ Agnes 	okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, I've seen it.
► ■ Andrei 	I think I've seen it a second time on T_V_, but maybe not entirely.
► ■ Agnes 	So have we all seen it?
► ■ Mirek 	I've I've see- I've seen it, but I can't really remember exactly the - all the details.
► ■ Agnes 	Okay, so we've all seen it.
► ■ Agnes 	I can't either, 'cause I saw it right when it came out.
► ■ Denis 	That's it's it's probably begin-
► ■ Mirek 	Uh.
► ■ Mirek 	It's a long time ago, it's from ninety one?
► ■ Agnes 	It came out when - ninety one, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Ninety one.
► ■ Mirek 	Ninety one, yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	So - and I saw it when I was like twelve or thirteen. $
► ■ Agnes 	So.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, me too.
► ■ Mirek 	So perhaps it would be -
► ■ Agnes 	And at that age I was like mm. @
► ■ Andrei 	They're much too young.
► ■ Denis 	Yep. $
	Episode #13 (keywords: Mirek, American Beauty)
► ■ Denis 	Okay, American Beauty w- w- was coming next, seven, was quite quite nice actually.
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah. Could you go to the next slide?
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah. That was very good, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Ah, it's actually there.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah, it's here, and that's actually my last slide. So um
► ■ Denis 	Why you choose* you choose seven movie?
► ■ Mirek 	I don't know, because it nicely f- I I was thinking perhaps we are not able to go through more of them.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Indeed.
► ■ Mirek 	Uh
► ■ Mirek 	So American Beauty,
► ■ Mirek 	so I can perhaps read a little bit the user comment if you want, or uh yeah,
► ■ Mirek 	you can read the plot outline on the on the on the projector,
► ■ Mirek 	but it's basically deep, wonderful and penetrating movie, extraordinary uh irony and the p- and the psychological drama about American life.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, it's definitely about American life.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Suburban life.
► ■ Denis 	It's it's kind of crude the critique, but uh on the other way it's quite poetic, it's uh - yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	There's a lot of very true things in it.
► ■ Mirek 	Poetic? $
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, you know, with the the way of filming and um -
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	I don't know, I found it pretty -
► ■ Mirek 	Okay, the way of filming perhaps, but uh -
► ■ Andrei 	I haven't seen it, but I would like to see it, so.
► ■ Denis 	No, it's q- it's quite in- interesting.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	So - yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	It's much less dark than the other movies we have on that list.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	Well, it depends.
► ■ Andrei 	So it's not very violent, really.
► ■ Agnes 	It's not - well it's dark but - no.
► ■ Denis 	Ah no, it's it's not violent at all,
► ■ Andrei 	Ah okay, great.
► ■ Agnes 	No.
► ■ Denis 	but more - it's more the cr- the cr- the critique that is quite crude, because all the people in this movie are are uh psychopath in their own way.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	But not like violent cutting people to pieces psychopaths they're - just everyone has their own issues and -
► ■ Denis 	But they are normal people then.
► ■ Andrei 	Okay, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh-huh.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	And what about the - well that picture with the the girl and -
► ■ Andrei 	do you see naked people in the movie or -
► ■ Denis 	Actually, there is this - it's uh uh what, a fifty years old man that quit his job and fall in love with um the best friend of his daughter.
► ■ Agnes 	No.
► ■ Andrei 	is it about sex or something like that?
► ■ Agnes 	Well -
► ■ Agnes 	With hi- his daughter, his like teenage daughter.
► ■ Andrei 	Ah okay.
► ■ Agnes 	So that's the best friend, and he fantasises about her and - $
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Supposedly. Okay.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, it's it's good movie.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh-huh.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Okay.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	And it's my last slide. So - uh yes, yes, yes. And I think, okay, why not.
	Episode #14 (keywords: Mirek, discussion)
► ■ Denis 	You have seen it, Mirek?
► ■ Mirek 	It seems to me that perhaps that Schindler - okay, definitely Schindler Schindler's List is perhaps more serious topic for sure,
► ■ Mirek 	but um - well it depends, it depends what we want.
► ■ Mirek 	Do we want that people are more like uh relaxed in our in our cinema, or are more interested in some particular things?
► ■ Mirek 	Um what do you think, I mean what should we - how we should uh -
► ■ Mirek 	What should be the influence, how we are influencing the people in the cinema?
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Um -
► ■ Denis 	I think we w- want them to to see movies that they won't see oth- otherwise, but I'm not sure then it's quite popular the movie we selected, so.
► ■ Mirek 	What do we want?
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, I think it's a mixture of bringing new things to them, but also making them enjoy the show, so that they come to our movie club, so
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	yeah, I think we shouldn't maybe do very mainstream movies, but
► ■ Andrei 	well okay, the list here is quite uh -
► ■ Agnes 	See I don't know what was mainstream in Europe,
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	like all of these movies are very mainstream for me.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, I think also if you look at the number of votes here.
► ■ Agnes 	But -
► ■ Denis 	If they are in the top fifty, they are quite mainstream, but uh
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah. Uh.
► ■ Andrei 	Regarding Denis's table I would say given that this site, I don't know if it's mainly American, but uh I would say that -
► ■ Agnes 	It has other movies, but I think it's predominantly -
► ■ Denis 	Uh I think there is the -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, I think mm - yeah, it's English speaking anyway, so uh - though - so -
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	There are Chinese movies, English movies.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, but if you look at
► ■ Agnes 	No, there's movies from everywhere, but -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	But I would say mainstream are the ones that have more than, whatever, sixty thousand votes,
► ■ Andrei 	and you can see some more, well, confidential films that have like ten thousand, twenty thousand, like mm Princess Mononoke, twenty thousand and uh, whatever, the the Kieslowski at eleven thousand, the Trois Coleurs Rouge.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	It's it's quite a lot for Kieslowski actually.
► ■ Denis 	I was surprised to see-
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, it's not bad at all, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	So yeah, anyway, if you want a definition of mainstream or whatever.
► ■ Mirek 	Hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	And Festen also is uh is quite high.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	Uh I I don't know if you've seen this one.
► ■ Andrei 	Yep.
► ■ Agnes 	No, I've never even heard of it.
► ■ Denis 	It's The Celebration I think.
► ■ Denis 	It's uh uh movie from a Swedish guy.
► ■ Andrei 	D- uh Danish I think, it's the Dogma movement.
► ■ Denis 	Danish?
► ■ Denis 	Dogma movies, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Lars von Trier.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Oh okay.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
	Episode #15 (keywords: Andrei, presentation, Saving Private Ryan)
► ■ Denis 	Okay, can we .. discuss about your document, maybe?
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, let's uh -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	so it's uh -
► ■ Mirek 	Maybe - can I ask you for the for the list of movies?
► ■ Andrei 	actually I have made I have made photocopies.
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Andrei 	I have them Denis, so it's all for you.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Actually I I tried to propose just one movie with some alternates.
► ■ Agnes 	Thank you.
► ■ Mirek 	This one. And the -
► ■ Andrei 	You want one?
► ■ Mirek 	Denis, Denis, could you give me the the list of the to- uh top fifty? Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, sure.
► ■ Mirek 	But you have your own copy then?
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Mirek 	okay, good, thank you.
► ■ Andrei 	Um so my proposal, .. which is only a proposal, would be to to keep the focus on um uh more or less history and action,
► ■ Andrei 	so Lawrence of Arabia was, okay, about this guy during the first world war, so -
► ■ Andrei 	it happens, okay, outside Europe and the States, but uh it's a piece of history.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh Apocalypse Now it's uh Vietnam, if I'm um correct
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	and, okay, Amadeus, that's much uh much earlier and it's not about -
► ■ Andrei 	it's not violent, which is a nice thing I think.
► ■ Andrei 	But um given that we would like a movie from the nineties, I thought the Saving Private Ryan -
► ■ Andrei 	oh thanks for projecting the document -
► ■ Andrei 	um would keep this - more or less this theme of uh history and war and action drama, while showing actually a very new and I would say humanistic view on on war.
► ■ Andrei 	Because it's it's not like the sort of glorification of uh, you know, the good guys that that uh well go against the Nazis, but uh it's uh it's -
► ■ Andrei 	well the plot actually if you don't know it -
► ■ Andrei 	it's about people looking for just one soldier in fact
► ■ Andrei 	it's um it's about a a family of four brothers, who -
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	actually three of them get killed during the war in these days of forty - well, I guess summer forty four
► ■ Andrei 	and the uh well the government decides that they need to get back the fourth brother just to save one member of the family.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	And this this guy is Private Ryan.
► ■ Andrei 	So the movie is not about killing the Germans or whatever,
► ■ Andrei 	it's about saving at least one guy from a family, so -
► ■ Andrei 	but of course the the setting is during the war and um it's very realistic and uh very dramatic in fact.
► ■ Andrei 	It's um it's not at all a glorification of war but it's just uh -
► ■ Andrei 	it shows a bit uh the violence of um of the things.
► ■ Andrei 	And especially the the beginning is uh - I think it's great, it's it's very violent, but it's it's an image of of war. It's uh -
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	It's v- very very violent.
► ■ Denis 	It's quite horrible actually.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, but I think if mm - well if you compare it with -
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Mirek, you didn't see it?
► ■ Mirek 	That's the - I I I saw it and I d- I'm trying to remember the beginning, that's the Normandy landing?
► ■ Agnes 	The landing, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	It yeah, it's the landing, and actually every- more or less everyone gets killed and -
► ■ Mirek 	Okay, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, that was really horrible.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	This is not a movie for kids, like -
► ■ Denis 	But it's it's a piece of art because he used something like one hundred camera to film that, or -
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Oh I I didn't know,
► ■ Andrei 	but yeah, actually it's very well filmed and it's very realistic,
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Andrei 	and, I don't know, if you compare with, I don't know, in Lawrence of Arabia I think they have some battles and camels, I know it's very nice, someone falls somewhere there and, well you know, it's like battles that look nice,
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah it's quite s- yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	but this one doesn't look nice,
► ■ Mirek 	No, not at all.
► ■ Andrei 	and I think it's uh it's also maybe representative of the nineties,
► ■ Andrei 	you know, people starting to get the more uh realistic view of uh of of war.
► ■ Andrei 	But it's true, it's it's a bit violent, and so what I put here -
► ■ Andrei 	it's a bit long too, it's nearly three hours.
► ■ Andrei 	But uh I don't know, Apocalypse Now is quite long too I think
► ■ Agnes 	yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, it is.
► ■ Denis 	There is two - there are two versions I think, and - but w- but we - yeah, we projected the longer one, so.
► ■ Andrei 	I don't remember.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, the redux version is longer.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	So it won uh five Oscar prizes, uh best director for Steven Spielberg,
► ■ Andrei 	um best cimena- cinematography, etcetera. Uh -
► ■ Denis 	How many times uh Spielberg received the best uh director Oscar?
► ■ Agnes 	I think just once for this.
► ■ Andrei 	I don't know.
► ■ Denis 	Not for the Schin- Schindler's* List or for
► ■ Agnes 	Oh maybe he did.
► ■ Denis 	for E_T_?
► ■ Agnes 	No, for E_T_ he didn't.
► ■ Denis 	He won f- he won the mm -
► ■ Agnes 	It wasn't until he started doing things like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan that he actually started winning awards for them.
► ■ Andrei 	Oh.
► ■ Denis 	No, he won f- for E_T_, he won the mm Cannes, uh what is - uh Palme d'Or.
► ■ Andrei 	Hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Did he?
► ■ Agnes 	Oh okay, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	I didn't know that.
► ■ Andrei 	Um okay,
► ■ Andrei 	so um yeah, that's that's the point, it's it's a bit grey,
► ■ Andrei 	and actually if you look at my second page,
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	uh in the trivia I found out that in fact they uh actually reduced the the colour saturation of the movie,
► ■ Andrei 	just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentaries from the time.
► ■ Denis 	That was very interesting to read, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, I was very surprised to find this uh - it's -
► ■ Denis 	But then they uh - I read that they they -
► ■ Andrei 	They they turned back the colours for uh - $
► ■ Denis 	w- where was it?
► ■ Agnes 	They re-enhanced the colour, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Th- they turned back to - yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Because people start to complain that uh that w- there was a problem with a T_V_ when they were broadcasting the movie on the T_V_. Uh - $
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	That it was their T_V_s and not -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	So this uh fact number two I think obviously for - I mean - technical people like us is uh is is is quite funny.
► ■ Mirek 	That's an interesting point, interesting point. $
► ■ Andrei 	So yeah, so I I mean these four points could serve also as an introduction if you want to talk f- fo- for fi- five or ten minutes before the movie, I don't know, in in the room.
► ■ Andrei 	So uh yeah, mm so tha- this would be my candidate, but I'm very much open to -
	Episode #16 (keywords: Andrei, hero, Private Ryan)
► ■ Denis 	And then then there is this uh - there is an hero, I mean it's uh - or a non-hero, and in all the other stu- stories, the - in the previous movies there were an he- an hero, Lawrence of Arabia, uh Amadeus.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	Apocalypse Now, it's also non-hero I think, but uh but here I don't remember it's actually the Tom Hanks the hero, or it's -
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, on th- on - yeah, on the picture actually - yeah, it's Tom Hanks.
► ■ Andrei 	In fact you you don't see uh Private Ryan until the end more or less, or you see mm - because they they're looking for him,
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, about two thirds of the way through the movie, 'cause most of the movie is them find- trying to find him on the front, right?
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah, but in the end you can ref- yes.
► ■ Andrei 	yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	He's Private Ryan, Tom Hanks?
► ■ Agnes 	No, no.
► ■ Andrei 	No, Tom Tom -
► ■ Denis 	No he's not.
► ■ Mirek 	No.
► ■ Denis 	He's trying to find him.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, he's trying to find him.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Well the caption says Captain John Miller, so -
► ■ Andrei 	So i- if you look at the caption um -
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	yep
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	so he's uh he's -
► ■ Agnes 	Private Ryan was Matt Damon I think, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	So the Private is just a simple soldier actually. Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	By the way, did he fied* dinally* - uh f- fi- died finally or not?
► ■ Andrei 	Uh who, Private Ryan or -
► ■ Mirek 	Uh the Private Ryan, yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	No no, they find him actually and they send him back to the family, but the Captain dies actually, Tom Han-
► ■ Mirek 	Th- they - I remember I remember they found him, but -
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	ah okay, yes yes yes.
► ■ Agnes 	Is it him at the begin- it's him at the beginning of the movie at the at the the graveyard, right?
► ■ Andrei 	L-
► ■ Mirek 	Because I remember - #
► ■ Andrei 	Oh yeah, it's Private Ryan, yeah, remembering at the beginning.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, with his family. Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Because I remember that th- in the end of the movie they are trying to defend some bridge or something and there's quite heavy shooting and uh finally it's actually John Miller who die.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, exactly, yeah, he dies unfortunately.
► ■ Mirek 	Okay okay.
► ■ Andrei 	So yeah, there is sacrifice and -
► ■ Mirek 	It's not the Private Ryan
► ■ Denis 	At the end, to tell you the truth, I didn't like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic, because there were a guy who was - who didn't kill German because he was quite non-violent.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	And because he didn't kill this German, the German killed, I don't know, uh maybe um -
► ■ Andrei 	Oh.
► ■ Mirek 	Perhaps it was a g- uh this uh Tom Hanks, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Oh yeah, yeah.
► ■ Denis 	And it was like, if he had killed the mm
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, the German.
► ■ Mirek 	If he would kill him, he wouldn't die. Wow. Tom Hanks wouldn't die.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh-huh. Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Because he- e- yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Well I mean yeah, it has a moral dimension all over the movie, you know, saving the individual and the guys.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	So yeah, I I don't know, I don't know how many people have have seen it -
► ■ Andrei 	well, among you, well, most of you actually.
► ■ Agnes 	I have.
► ■ Denis 	I have.
► ■ Mirek 	I've seen it. I've seen it.
► ■ Andrei 	Oh all, okay, all of us.
► ■ Andrei 	So maybe th- people know it quite well.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, we're running um -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Out of time?
	Episode #17 (keywords: Andrei, other candidates)
► ■ Andrei 	Okay, so - yeah, so I have some other candidates, um -
► ■ Andrei 	it's on first page at the bottom.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh I also put Pulp Fiction, uh The Silence of the Lambs and I also, well, sort of included ^La Vita e Bella^,
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	but I know we're an Engish movie club, so I guess it's um it's a bit out of purpose.
► ■ Mirek 	What is the movie about, the ^La Vita e Bella^?
► ■ Andrei 	But it -
► ■ Andrei 	Oh it's uh it's about - again about the camps and the Second World War.
► ■ Denis 	But it was in English, no?
► ■ Mirek 	Ah-ha.
► ■ Andrei 	So it's about uh a family of Italians which uh g- arrives into a a death camp,
► ■ Agnes 	I don't think so. No, it was an Italian.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Uh-huh.
► ■ Andrei 	and in fact it's treated in a more or less humorous mode,
► ■ Andrei 	so um the father tries to hide from i- from his boy that they are in a death camp,
► ■ Mirek 	Uh-huh uh-huh.
► ■ Andrei 	and it's this very strange mm well, not really humour, but relation between the uh - how
► ■ Mirek 	How it end up, what is the what is the ending of the movie?
► ■ Andrei 	Well the boy gets saved, but the father dies.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah. So I don't know
► ■ Andrei 	i- it created some controversies I think, because people said you shouldn't do any form of humour related to the camps,
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	but it's very very moving, so I think it's - anyway um Italian, so.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	That's actually the third movie about the Second War. Schindler's List, a P- uh Saving Private Ryan and ^La Vita e Bella^.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yep. Yeah.
	Episode #18 (keywords: Denis, presentation, The Big Lebowski)
► ■ Andrei 	Okay uh Denis.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	Yep, so I have uh a quite different movie to propose you.
► ■ Denis 	I don't know uh - it's f- called The Big Lebowski from um uh Joel Coen.
► ■ Denis 	Actually they are brothers*, you probably know them.
► ■ Denis 	I don't know how many of you have seen this movie.
► ■ Agnes 	No.
► ■ Andrei 	Haven't seen it, but uh I heard it's very funny.
► ■ Denis 	No?
► ■ Mirek 	Just partially I think.
► ■ Andrei 	And I've seen some other films by by the Coen brothers.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, they made uh Fargo, which is in the list.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, which is in your table.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	And uh
► ■ Andrei 	Um the last one was the one with Catherine Zeta-Jones uh.
► ■ Denis 	uh Cr- uh Cruel Intentions, or something like that I think, or -
► ■ Andrei 	Crue- crue-
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, something about cruelty or - very funny.
► ■ Denis 	Okay so, I don't know how I'm going to sell you this movie, because actually the plot is impossible to make, because it's um - actually it's inspired from a movie called The Big Sleep and um -
► ■ Andrei 	A movie or a novel?
► ■ Denis 	Uh it's actually the t- where I've seen that?
► ■ Denis 	In a - it's uh a movie from Raymond Chandler, The Big Sleep.
► ■ Denis 	It's uh -
► ■ Andrei 	No, but they say that Raymond Chandler wrote the novel.
► ■ Denis 	Ah okay.
► ■ Andrei 	You see, it's the the last but one paragraph on your second page.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah yeah yeah.
► ■ Denis 	So it's it's uh it's a novel, okay.
► ■ Denis 	But uh - then the story goes that while that film was in production - and director Howard Hawks,
► ■ Andrei 	I think so.
► ■ Denis 	okay, okay you're right, it was a book.
► ■ Denis 	Okay, so it's about a a g- a guy wh- called the D- the Dude, I don't know you pronounce it,
► ■ Denis 	and uh he's actually uh smoking pot and doing nothing, just um - he's living in L_A_.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm.
► ■ Denis 	It's uh it's a typical typical fellow from the from the suburb,
► ■ Denis 	and he has some friends, uh typical friends,
► ■ Denis 	one one is uh an old guy from - coming back from Vietnam, obsessed by Vietnam,
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	um another guy who is never speaking,
► ■ Denis 	and they all play together uh bowling.
► ■ Denis 	And um
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	the casting is very interesting, there is um -
► ■ Denis 	okay, actually I wanted to propose you some posters related to this movie.
► ■ Denis 	Uh maybe it w- maybe it's going to open the discussion on on posters as well.
► ■ Denis 	So actually here you - on this - the first poster you can see the actors from the movie,
► ■ Denis 	I don't know if you know some of them,
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	so Jeff Bridges at the top, uh Goodman is the second one, the b- the big guy. Then Turturro, and uh uh the last one is Buscemi, and I don't remember the name of the girl.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm it's Julianne Moore, isn't it? Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Um -
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, Julianne Moore.
► ■ Andrei 	Y- you wrote the paragraph on the poster?
► ■ Denis 	Uh I I took it from - I don't know where. So uh
► ■ Andrei 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Could be edited a bit.
► ■ Denis 	Actu-
► ■ Denis 	Actually I'm not going to sp- to describe much more The Big Lebowski, but uh it's quite hard to describe, it's uh it's it's a journey about this guy,
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	but it's it's a movie, quite surrealistic, I mean there are some part that are like coming from dreams and uh - @
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Why the movie is called The Big Lebowski? Why The Big -
► ■ Mirek 	uh Lebowski is his uh family name, right,
► ■ Mirek 	but why it's called The Big -
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, it's his family name and uh actually Jeffrey Lebowski and he's he's the -
► ■ Denis 	there is a a story with another Lebowski that - yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah. Yeah, there are two Lebowskis in the film.
► ■ Mirek 	Okay.
► ■ Mirek 	And why The Big Lebowski?
► ■ Denis 	And uh -
► ■ Mirek 	It's the it's the second one or - $
► ■ Denis 	I I I don't remember, maybe it's just uh uh because of The Big Sleep there is uh
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Uh-huh.
► ■ Mirek 	Ah okay, okay. Uh-huh.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, there should be a reference there.
► ■ Denis 	I don't know, a reference.
► ■ Denis 	So it's a kind of - it's like American Beauty in some way, it's even worse*.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	We see worse people.
► ■ Denis 	So it's kind of uh an ethnographic movie I would say, but uh - and it's a modern hero, it's it's quite fun.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	And the casting is is marvellous -
► ■ Denis 	So that is - that's it for this movie.
	Episode #19 (keywords: Denis, posters)
► ■ Denis 	And um I just wanted to go to the design of the poster actually.
► ■ Agnes 	Hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	I quite like that.
► ■ Denis 	Because -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah. It's probably a bit dark for a poster, but otherwise it's very nice.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Yep.
► ■ Denis 	The idea is is also to discuss the content.
► ■ Denis 	Shall we put a summary of the movie or the plot,
► ■ Denis 	and w- what kind of information do we want?
► ■ Denis 	So that's the first poster.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	There is also um this poster, quite dark also.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	Uh so y- y- I don't know if you - you cannot really see, but uh mm there is the the pricing information.
► ■ Denis 	So we said that one movie is eight Francs and three movies eighteen Francs. And we can have annual subscrip- subscription of sixty Francs.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	Uh I wanted to say some information to involve people on - in the committee as well, if they want to take part to the committee to select movies.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	And uh - what else?
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	S- some -
► ■ Mirek 	I think this is not bad, because they say something little bit about our uh movie club
► ■ Mirek 	and uh, yeah, The Big Lebowski it's clear that it's a movie and uh
► ■ Mirek 	I guess the people can remember that it was a movie at least, even if they haven't see it.
► ■ Agnes 	Looks like a C_D_ cover. $
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm. $
► ■ Mirek 	CD cover. $
► ■ Denis 	Yeah, actually the idea was to s- yeah, there is at the bottom the - a scene from one of these dream of The Big Lebowski.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Oh okay, it's a dream.
► ■ Denis 	And uh the the first part is actually y- you see a cowboy and the the hero, the- Jeffrey Lebowski, the Dude.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Denis 	And the cowboy, it's actually - at the beginning of the movie, the c- the cowboy introduces the story, and he's coming back at the end of the story, and he's e- explaining what kind of movie uh you are going to to see. $
► ■ Agnes 	Oh okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Okay, sounds a bit crazy.
► ■ Denis 	And last posters -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Hmm.
► ■ Denis 	So same principle, but I w- I don't know, I w- I was thinking of adding some some um cita- quotations of uh well known directors.
► ■ Andrei 	Uh-huh.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	And uh -
► ■ Andrei 	I like it because it's not so dark, so the images are a bit um brighter.
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah, but I - on the contrary I would say there is too many colours and uh it's difficult to read and uh -
► ■ Agnes 	I actually don't like it. $
► ■ Agnes 	It looks like two - yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	It's - it looks like two separate posters.
► ■ Agnes 	Although I think you can mix -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	I would keep the format of the first one, add the quotes and the content information from the second one.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah. Mm-hmm.
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah, that would be the best.
► ■ Agnes 	So take those take those quotes,
► ■ Agnes 	get rid of that section of text,
► ■ Mirek 	%
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Denis 	Yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	put those quotes in there,
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Agnes 	put the the information you had in the second poster about the movie club, how to join, kind of in the middle
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up.
► ■ Denis 	Okay, I see.
► ■ Andrei 	Wh- what about a brighter background, because this one, I don't know how it would show on a wall or something like this.
► ■ Andrei 	It doesn't really catch your attention.
► ■ Agnes 	I think it does.
► ■ Andrei 	'Kay.
► ■ Denis 	And yeah.
► ■ Agnes 	I think the contrast between the the the strip of film and - or the strip of pictures and everything else is -
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah. Okay.
► ■ Denis 	Okay, I see -
► ■ Denis 	what I wanted is more or less to know the content of the movie, uh what y- you want to have on the poster.
► ■ Mirek 	%
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah.
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah. No, the content was very good in the second one. Th-
► ■ Denis 	Because we di- we -
► ■ Denis 	Okay, on that one.
► ■ Agnes 	Yeah, so take all of that content,
► ■ Andrei 	Yeah, all this information is very good.
► ■ Mirek 	Yeah, all this information and put into the first one.
► ■ Agnes 	throw it up into the first one,
► ■ Mirek 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Andrei 	Mm-hmm.
► ■ Agnes 	and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the from the famous directors sort of at the bottom or something.
► ■ Denis 	Okay.
► ■ Andrei 	Oh or just one of them.
► ■ Mirek 	If if they fit there if they fit there, you will see.
