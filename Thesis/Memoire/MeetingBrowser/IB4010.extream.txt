MIO046 	159.64	160.02 0.218181818181818 Okay 	
MIO046 	160.48	161.8 0.0872727272727273 I guess we can start with you 	
FIE038 	163.82	165.35 0.218909090909091 It's not very long in any case 	
MIO046 	166.71	167.39 0.219636363636364 here it is 	
MIO046 	168.73	169.64 0.220363636363636 I pass this one 	
FIE038 	169.03	169.85 0.221090909090909 Mm yeah 	
FIE038 	169.85	170.57 0.221818181818182 i 	
FIE038 	172.57	180.04 0.0610909090909091 Okay so What i was thinking is basically the previous movies that we had which you've already mentioned see in the agenda um 	
FIE038 	180.04	188.46	0.222545454545455 once every the apocalypse now and amadeus What really historical serious dramatic and also action in movies except for maybe amadeus 	
FIE038 	189.1	189.59	0.223272727272727 Um 	
FIE038 	189.59	196.23	0.00290909090909091 that's not i was thinking of selecting something that's more in the present time Still dramatic but slightly less serious 	
FIE038 	197.24	199.23	0.224 And what i propose is something of uh 	
FIE038 	199.58	200.78	0.224727272727273 A thriller a mystery 	
FIE038 	202.09	203.66	0.225454545454545 know that a lot of people find 	
FIE038 	204.15	208.22	0.0698181818181818 Mysteries not really missed reason the movies these days a kind of can predict what's gonna happen 	
FIE038 	208.87	209.36	0.226181818181818 Um 	
FIE038 	209.36	215.08	0.171636363636364 but in the nineties there were some movies that did have supplies and things and and people came out saying okay didn't see that coming 	
FIE038 	215.57	217.56	0.226909090909091 So i thought we could maybe show one of those 	
FIE038 	217.96	222.72	0.0138181818181818 And Even if people are very seen the movie a lot of the times you go back and watch the movie again 	
FIE038 	223.13	232.46	0.101090909090909 And you pick up on things that you didn't really notice the first time around or you see where the clues work And what led up to the end so that's more along the lines of us thinking 	
FIE038 	233.41	236.19	0.227636363636364 And it to in particular that i would propose are 	
FIE038 	237.4	238.35	0.168727272727273 Next slide please 	
FIE038 	239.01	241.66	0.0792727272727273 The usual suspects and a six cents um 	
FIE038 	241.66	243.81	0.228363636363636 i don't know if you've seen any of them 	
FIE038 	244.38	250.63	0.08 Uh the usual suspects Why is directed by brian singer and written by chris from corey 	
FIE038 	251.13	257.83	0.229090909090909 It has a fairly large cast so i'm not gonna read all of them but the main characters you kevin spacey and gabriel byrne 	
FIE038 	258.51	259.65	0.229818181818182 And it's basically 	
FIE038 	260.25	262.05	0.230545454545455 criminals to get set out 	
FIE038 	262.73	263.17	0.231272727272727 Um 	
FIE038 	263.17	265.36	0.232 the rested The release from prison 	
FIE038 	266.13	267.07	0.232727272727273 They get together 	
FIE038 	267.52	268.17	0.233454545454545 Um 	
FIE038 	268.17	270.27	0.0705454545454546 and it's kind of crime 	
FIE038 	270.93	275.05	0.0196363636363636 And basically the stories tall through the views of one of the suspects 	
FIE038 	275.8	276.38	0.234181818181818 Um 	
FIE038 	276.7	280.16	0.234909090909091 That had one is kinda neat five criminals one line at know common sense 	
FIE038 	280.61	283.23	0.235636363636364 And you get whole story um 	
FIE038 	283.23	283.96	0.236363636363636 as 	
FIE038 	284.86	285.27	0.237090909090909 Uh 	
FIE038 	285.27	288.39	0.237818181818182 that these characters you being control um 	
FIE038 	288.39	290.54	0.238545454545455 by one sort of ravel and 	
FIE038 	291.07	293.56	0.124363636363636 And in the end you find it in brazil and what is 	
FIE038 	294.13	299.47	0.00945454545454546 And i kind of like the the call for rolling stone magazine the usual suspects the fascist funniest 	
MIO046 	298.85	303.9	0.176727272727273 Which which one was it again the guy was controlling i don't remember i have seen the movie twice but uh 	
FIE038 	303.84	305.62	0.239272727272727 Well they had any guess in a movie 	
MIO036 	305.6	306.5	0.24 No i haven't seen a 	
MIO095 	306.25	306.88	0.240727272727273 No i haven't 	
MIO046 	306.97	308.8	0.241454545454545 It's the bald guy the 	
FIE038 	307.09	309.13	0.242181818181818 So i'm not gonna give away 	
FIE038 	309.83	311.1	0.242909090909091 You wanna go away the movie 	
MIO046 	310.9	313.83	0.243636363636364 I know that i i 	
FIE038 	312.4	314.99	0.244363636363636 Well i i was a u. s. i. 	
FIE038 	316.22	324.01	0.0472727272727273 But the the call from rolling stone is fairly accurate i think it's one of the freshest fun isn't scary is kinda worse to come along since pulp fiction 	
FIE038 	325.19	330.44	0.064 And the other movie is a six cents worth the famous line i see that people watch the little boy says 	
FIE038 	331.22	331.65	0.245090909090909 Um 	
FIE038 	331.65	338.98	0.245818181818182 it was written and directed by and they uh she on the line And stars bruce willis really joe was meant and then it'll act 	
FIE038 	339.61	342.55	0.125090909090909 And again it has any twice that you find out right at the end 	
MIO046 	343.93	344.41	0.246545454545455 Yeah 	
MIO046 	344.41	347.02	0.155636363636364 it's a bit more commercial that one but yeah for school 	
FIE038 	346.21	346.53	0.247272727272727 Yeah 	
MIO036 	347.41	347.86	0.248 Uh-huh 	
FIE038 	347.94	350.41	0.248727272727273 I mean yeah this expense was very commercial that 	
MIO036 	351.92	357.28	0.0334545454545455 So what what is this the second image on the slide is that the the poster or 	
FIE038 	356.33	361.29	0.0123636363636364 It's the poster for the sixth sense but unfortunately i couldn't find it clear big enough one 	
MIO036 	362.32	364.27	0.249454545454545 it has a strange format um 	
FIE038 	364.65	365.01	0.250181818181818 Yeah 	
MIO036 	364.86	368.27	0.250909090909091 Horizontal and also it's one two three four five six 	
FIE038 	365.84	366.3	0.251636363636364 Yeah i 	
FIE038 	366.77	369.02	0.252363636363636 I think it's only part of the fall yeah 	
FIE038 	369.02	371.92	0.253090909090909 it was the all the set all the senses 	
FIE038 	372.51	373.02	0.253818181818182 Um 	
FIE038 	373.02	373.71	0.254545454545455 if you do the next 	
FIE038 	374.16	381.15	0.0109090909090909 slightly more detailed things about the movies So the usual suspects is a hundred five minutes long so it's 	
MIO036 	375.3	375.73	0.255272727272727 Uh-huh 	
FIE038 	381.62	382.77	0.256 I. d. some point of time

MIO095 	791.01	791.76	0.372363636363636 huh this one is 	
MIO095 	792.37	793.1	0.373090909090909 it's uh 	
MIO095 	793.1	796.19	0.373818181818182 you know all all all of you know so the the story so 	
MIO036 	794.96	795.32	0.374545454545455 Uh-huh 	
FIE038 	796.04	796.35	0.375272727272727 Uh-huh 	
MIO095 	797.65	798.05	0.376 Uh 	
MIO095 	798.74	802.88	0.376727272727273 It's quite hot uh it's quite a higher ranked so i think uh 	
MIO095 	802.88	807.09	0.377454545454545 it's not a bad movie i'm i'm thinking whether there was some good occasion uh 	
MIO095 	807.09	807.68	0.378181818181818 something but 	
MIO095 	808.58	811.35	0.378909090909091 Has happened recently that was something like a celebration of the 	
MIO095 	812.32	814.91	0.145454545454545 Fifty years after the war or something chris and 	
MIO036 	815.73	816.48	0.379636363636364 Um 	
MIO095 	816.46	816.72	0.380363636363636 No 	
MIO046 	816.67	817.2	0.381090909090909 Sixteen 	
MIO036 	816.84	821.64	0.381818181818182 I think there was a celebration of us sixty years from the liberation of the cameras 	
MIO046 	818.32	819.04	0.382545454545455 Six years 	
MIO095 	819.49	819.95	0.383272727272727 Stay yeah 	
MIO095 	820.47	821.98	0.146181818181818 Is it can be fifty sure 	
MIO036 	822.35	825.04	0.130181818181818 Because they were the brave the beginning forty five 	
MIO095 	824.31	824.87	0.384 Yeah 	
MIO095 	825.18	825.96	0.384727272727273 So 	
MIO036 	826.23	833.51	0.0341818181818182 Yeah it's not bad and it's also i think it's a good idea but at least from my point of view it's coherent with the previous films like history 	
MIO036 	833.97	839.69	0.385454545454545 In the major events I don't know if we want to keep this coherence or Change radical it but maybe 	
MIO095 	833.99	834.43	0.386181818181818 That's true 	
MIO046 	834.86	835.66	0.386909090909091 That's right yeah 	
FIE038 	839.16	840.5	0.387636363636364 Very emotional movie uh 	
MIO036 	840.71	841.39	0.388363636363636 Yeah that's 	
FIE038 	840.94	842.63	0.389090909090909 That's one thing to keep in mind is that it 	
MIO036 	841.79	842.99	0.389818181818182 Yeah i think it's a drawback 	
MIO046 	842.94	843.9	0.390545454545455 But then it's not 	
MIO036 	843.36	843.87	0.391272727272727 Uh 	
MIO046 	844.7	849.44	0.0632727272727273 All present that even of the nineties it's more a movie about the story of uh 	
MIO046 	850.2	851.75	0.392 They'll all on uh 	
MIO046 	851.75	854.54	0.392727272727273 on job i did you wish doing is the second world war 	
FIE038 	854.57	857.91	0.393454545454545 Yeah but i mean this isn't really representative of the easily i 	
MIO046 	856.96	857.71	0.394181818181818 I 	
MIO095 	857.18	858.09	0.394909090909091 I 	
MIO036 	858.13	859.72	0.395636363636364 Well of the seventeen eighties 	
MIO046 	859.46	860.17	0.396363636363636 Yeah 	
FIE038 	859.81	863.69	0.397090909090909 Yeah and according to your thing it's nineteen eighty four is i 	
MIO046 	860.17	860.82	0.397818181818182 but it's 	
MIO036 	866.3	873.32	0.398545454545455 Maybe it's representative of a style of the eighties i don't know that's why i'm against that so i that's I dunno 	
MIO046 	870.31	870.83	0.399272727272727 Yeah 	
MIO046 	870.83	871.06	0.4 yeah 	
MIO095 	873.26	879.42	0.173818181818182 Mm but even here i wouldn't uh uh say that the the the the style it's a representative of the nineties right so on 	
FIE038 	879.36	879.64	0.400727272727273 Yeah 	
MIO036 	879.72	880.84	0.401454545454545 Yeah right uh 	
MIO095 	880.55	881.16	0.402181818181818 Um 	
MIO095 	882.36	883.7	0.402909090909091 Okay but uh 	
MIO095 	883.7	887.47	0.403636363636364 anyway i think it's it's real good movie i like it when i say and the 	
FIE038 	885.38	886.69	0.404363636363636 It is a good movie yeah 	
MIO046 	888.5	891.66	0.405090909090909 Okay and it's just it's a it's a very good As uh 	
MIO095 	889.63	892.73	0.405818181818182 It's one of the candidates i definitely a steven spielberg is recorded 	
MIO095 	893.28	896.55	0.406545454545455 So i i director so i i would say we we could think about it 	
MIO046 	897.08	897.45	0.407272727272727 Okay 	
MIO095 	897.15	899.23	0.408 So i would keep it as a candidate at least 	
FIE038 	898.92	899.27	0.408727272727273 Yeah 	
MIO095 	900.82	901.03	0.409454545454545 So 	
MIO046 	901.11	901.55	0.410181818181818 Okay 	
MIO046 	901.55	904.71	0.0807272727272727 the usual suspect do we want to say something it in about it or 	
MIO095 	903.56	903.99	0.410909090909091 Um 	
MIO095 	904.73	906.92	0.411636363636364 No one i think we can just get this like 	
MIO046 	906.59	907.94	0.412363636363636 Oh come it's coming for 	
MIO046 	909.59	910.35	0.413090909090909 On the list 	
FIE038 	911.24	911.58	0.413818181818182 Yeah 	
MIO095 	911.27	911.91	0.414545454545455 And yeah 	
MIO046 	913.57	920.87	0.415272727272727 It's false on and he's uh and on my knees that took a huge use a cat some movies no you didn't take of six first 	
MIO095 	920.06	921.43	0.416 Yeah that's true that is the root 	
MIO036 	921.89	923.72	0.416727272727273 Yeah it's funny actually um 	
MIO095 	923.99	925.06	0.417454545454545 That is it's changed 	
MIO036 	924.68	936.66	0.00363636363636364 Because on your on your slides actually the ratings are eight point seven for both No they have the same usual suspects and pulp fiction those are at eight point seven but on the nice table 	
MIO095 	929.01	929.55	0.418181818181818 It's higher 	
MIO036 	937.04	937.75	0.418909090909091 Uh this one is that 	
FIE038 	937.25	938.63	0.419636363636364 I guess that they they they like 	
MIO036 	938.25	938.83	0.420363636363636 six 	
MIO095 	938.43	939.67	0.421090909090909 It gets outdated 	
MIO036 	939.51	941.69	0.114181818181818 When i was maybe people voted for it yeah 	
MIO095 	941.67	944.49	0.421818181818182 Yes yes and i did i did it on wednesday 	
FIE038 	941.98	942.31	0.422545454545455 Yeah 	
MIO036 	942.51	944.04	0.423272727272727 Could have changed in the meanwhile 	
MIO046 	945.26	946.86	0.424 Amy i'm sure they probably 	
MIO036 	945.84	948.99	0.0436363636363636 The with one hundred thousand votes it shouldn't change too much 	
MIO036 	949.5	954.04	0.114909090909091 I mean given the number of votes i wonder but anyway it it may change i think yeah 	
MIO095 	953.07	953.41	0.424727272727273 Uh-huh 	
MIO095 	954.04	955.85	0.425454545454545 So it probably is trained so um 	
MIO095 	957.31	959.13	0.426181818181818 It becomes more popular no but uh 	
MIO095 	959.13	959.78	0.426909090909091 yeah 	
MIO095 	959.78	960.04	0.427636363636364 yeah 	
MIO046 	959.82	960.49	0.428363636363636 I 	
MIO095 	960.04	960.48	0.429090909090909 yeah yeah 	
MIO036 	960.13	960.56	0.429818181818182 Well 	
MIO046 	961.35	961.71	0.430545454545455 Okay 	
MIO036 	961.57	962.28	0.431272727272727 Encouraging 	
MIO046 	962.29	964.36	0.432 Do we have something to add on this movie or 	
FIE038 	964.83	965.75	0.432727272727273 Mm no 	
FIE038 	967.21	969.07	0.0938181818181818 We had numerous on schindler's list 	
FIE038 	969.65	973.62	0.433454545454545 Three of us to do it and shiny keep track of how do you have a sixteen 	
MIO095 	973.67	974.41	0.0945454545454545 Schindler's list 	
FIE038 	975.05	976.21	0.434181818181818 You have you have 	
MIO095 	975.16	975.93	0.434909090909091 It so it has 	
FIE038 	976.59	976.89	0.435636363636364 Yeah 	
MIO036 	976.87	977.37	0.436363636363636 Haven't 	
MIO036 	978.94	981.37	0.437090909090909 I've seen very few movies from the list 	
MIO036 	981.83	983.77	0.437818181818182 About ten out of the first yeah 	
MIO046 	983.54	985.15	0.438545454545455 And that's why you are in the movie club 	
MIO046 	985.75	986.78	0.439272727272727 To see more movies 	
MIO036 	985.84	986.35	0.44 Okay 	
MIO095 	988.34	991.45	0.0450909090909091 Okay pulp fiction i i think it's again quite um 	
MIO095 	991.45	995.53	0.440727272727273 a high higher ranked uh but From my perspective everybody already sorry 	
MIO095 	996.1	1002.89	0.102545454545455 Who was interested in that movie you so it always not interested in that movie he he didn't see time he wouldn't uh 	
MIO036 	996.79	997.16	0.441454545454545 Uh-huh 	
MIO095 	1002.89	1005.01	0.442181818181818 like to see in the in our more eco 	
MIO095 	1005.5	1011.51	0.442909090909091 So i think we should sit in a they should just leave it is keep it out and leave it out i i wouldn't think about this as a candidate 	
MIO046 	1012.16	1012.58	0.443636363636364 Why not 	
MIO095 	1012.3	1014.36	0.444363636363636 Even if it's a good movie but i don't know i think 	
MIO046 	1013.89	1018.97	0.174545454545455 It's quite well but not active of the nineties i think And the structure of the movies interesting 	
MIO046 	1020.34	1024.67	0.445090909090909 I i think that the first seeing is actually the same seen as of the lasting know 	
MIO036 	1021.08	1021.56	0.445818181818182 Uh-huh 	
MIO046 	1025.51	1027.22	0.0712727272727273 There is a kind of loop in this movie 	
FIE038 	1026.06	1027.07	0.446545454545455 I can't remember 	
IO095 	1028.21	1030.62	0.447272727272727 yes that i i think there are plenty of loops actually 	
MIO046 	1030.85	1031.06	0.448 Yep 	
FIE038 	1031.14	1036.83	0.0218181818181818 And also it's old enough that even if people start the first time around they don't necessarily remember everything that happened because 	
MIO095 	1031.23	1031.81	0.448727272727273 But if 	
MIO036 	1036.78	1037.16	0.449454545454545 Uh-huh 	
FIE038 	1037.51	1040.54	0.178909090909091 I remember seeing it when it came out that And uh particularly 	
MIO095 	1041.75	1042.77	0.450181818181818 If we agree you can see 	
MIO095 	1043.3	1044.61	0.103272727272727 three times perhaps three 	
MIO046 	1043.37	1043.58	0.450909090909091 Yeah 	
MIO046 	1043.58	1045.27	0.451636363636364 yeah it's a very bizarre yeah 	
MIO095 	1045.18	1055.34	0.104 for the for time so you still discover something you But uh on the other hand i had the impression it's really it's uh you know every everyone so wait it's it's quite don't know in uh in for it 	
MIO046 	1054.87	1055.84	0.452363636363636 You've you've seen it 	
MIO036 	1055.86	1056.81	0.453090909090909 Yeah i see to this 	
MIO095 	1056.95	1057.17	0.453818181818182 Yeah 	
MIO036 	1057.42	1058.28	0.454545454545455 I and i like it 	
FIE038 	1058.42	1059.06	0.455272727272727 So we've lost 	
MIO046 	1058.9	1061.24	0.152 And the sound track is uh is called use them so 	
MIO036 	1059.11	1059.9	0.456 I'm actually seen it 	
FIE038 	1062.13	1062.51	0.456727272727273 It's like 	
MIO046 	1062.66	1063.45	0.457454545454545 The soundtrack 	
FIE038 	1063.86	1065.46	0.179636363636364 And i don't remember the centre 	
MIO036 	1065.95	1068.19	0.458181818181818 Well it's plenty of well known songs 	
MIO095 	1066.03	1066.4	0.458909090909091 Mm yeah 	
MIO036 	1068.85	1069.1	0.459636363636364 Yeah 	
MIO036 	1069.91	1070.63	0.460363636363636 Twist thing 	
MIO095 	1070.26	1070.64	0.461090909090909 Mm 	
MIO046 	1070.46	1070.75	0.461818181818182 Yeah 	
MIO046 	1070.75	1070.94	0.462545454545455 yeah 	
MIO095 	1071.54	1071.93	0.463272727272727 So 	
MIO095 	1072.6	1076.37	0.464 But the think i live and think about these other candidate because it seems to me it's 	
MIO036 	1076.07	1077.71	0.464727272727273  I would keep it as a candidate that 	
MIO036 	1078.25	1082.94	0.465454545454545 I don't know i think for the moment in this most of the user candidate so we'll try to 	
MIO095 	1082.97	1083.32	0.466181818181818 Uh-huh 	
MIO046 	1083.29	1085.57	0.466909090909091 Well we've looked at the end all you want to know 	
MIO036 	1085.11	1087.97	0.115636363636364 Yeah we should probably vote off their everyone 	
FIE038 	1086.4	1086.84	0.467636363636364 Yeah i mean if 	
MIO095 	1086.61	1087.84	0.468363636363636 Well that's the best yeah 	
FIE038 	1087.32	1091.17	0.0974545454545455 that none of us like we can just eliminate it but we might as well leave everything top and 	
MIO095 	1091.12	1094.37	0.469090909090909 I'm going to week we could just a minute okay so we are not good i mean it is one 	
MIO095 	1095.52	1096.19	0.469818181818182 Uh yeah 	
MIO095 	1096.19	1097.38	0.470545454545455 good for last i didn't see

FIE038 	1426.85	1427.24	0.595636363636364 No 	
MIO036 	1427.2	1428.62	0.596363636363636 Is it about sex or something

MIO036 	1436.68	1437.37	0.599272727272727 Ah okay 	
MIO036 	1439.24	1440.1	0.6 I suppose that way 	
MIO036 	1442.94	1442.97	0.600727272727273 Mm 	
MIO036 	1443.57	1444.02	0.601454545454545 Okay 	
MIO046 	1443.64	1445.05	0.602181818181818 Yeah it's it's a good movie 	
MIO036 	1445.32	1445.69	0.602909090909091 Uh-huh 	
MIO046 	1448.6	1448.93	0.603636363636364 Okay 	
MIO095 	1449.1	1449.99	0.604363636363636 And that's my last slide 	
MIO095 	1450.5	1451.04	0.605090909090909 So 	
MIO046 	1450.68	1451.64	0.605818181818182 We have seen it yet 	
MIO095 	1452.5	1454.43	0.606545454545454 yes yes and i think okay why not 	
MIO095 	1455.77	1462.15	0.0952727272727273 It seems to me at perhaps a shame to okay so the physician that schindler's list Is perhaps more serious topic For sure 	
MIO095 	1462.65	1463.66	0.607272727272727 But uh 	
MIO095 	1463.66	1463.84	0.608 um 	
MIO095 	1464.62	1472.57	0.608727272727273 But it depends it depends what we want do we want that people are more like a relaxed in our in our cinema or are more interested in some topic or thinks 	
MIO095 	1473.63	1474.34	0.609454545454545 Oh uh 	
MIO095 	1474.34	1476.94	0.610181818181818 well the thing i mean what should we how we shoot uh 	
MIO095 	1478.38	1481.69	0.610909090909091 Which should be the influence how we are influencing the people in the cinema 	
MIO095 	1483.08	1483.56	0.611636363636364 Um 	
MIO046 	1484.67	1493.16	0.0596363636363636 I think we we want them to go to see movies that they want see all all the wires but i'm not sure then that's quite popular the movie was selected so 	
MIO095 	1485.03	1485.81	0.612363636363636 But do we want 	
MIO036 	1493.48	1494.19	0.613090909090909 Uh-huh 	
MIO036 	1494.19	1501.64	0.154181818181818 yeah i think it's a mixture of bringing new things to them but also making them enjoy the show so that they come to our movie called so 	
MIO036 	1502.01	1509.3	0.613818181818182 Yeah i think we shouldn't maybe two very mainstream movies that well okay the list here it's quite uh 	
FIE038 	1509.47	1513.97	0.614545454545455 See i don't know what was mainstream in europe like all of these movies of a mainstream for me 	
MIO036 	1514.65	1516.5	0.615272727272727 Yeah i think also if you look at the number of 	
MIO046 	1515.95	1519.14	0.0392727272727273 If they are in the top fifty they are quite mainstream but uh 	
MIO036 	1518.88	1519.34	0.616 Oh 	
MIO036 	1520.72	1528.64	0.0574545454545455 You know regarding denise table i would say given that the side I don't know if it's mainly american that's how i would say that 	
FIE038 	1528.07	1530.32	0.616727272727273 It has other movies but i think it's predominantly 	
MIO036 	1530.4	1534.39	0.617454545454545 Yeah i thing yeah it's english speaking anyway so uh 	
MIO046 	1530.42	1531.51	0.618181818181818 Uh 	
MIO046 	1531.51	1532.7	0.618909090909091 i think there is the 	
MIO036 	1535.17	1536.12	0.619636363636364 Though so 	
MIO046 	1535.74	1537.57	0.620363636363636 Chinese movies english movies 	
MIO036 	1537.46	1538.63	0.621090909090909 Yeah but if you look at 	
FIE038 	1538.15	1539.73	0.621818181818182 No there's no this from everywhere that 	
MIO036 	1540.14	1540.66	0.622545454545455 Yeah 	
MIO036 	1540.66	1542.74	0.623272727272727 but i would say mainstream are the 	
MIO036 	1543.14	1545.84	0.624 have more than whatever sixty thousand votes 	
MIO036 	1546.37	1548.3	0.624727272727273 And you can see some more 	
MIO036 	1548.98	1551.46	0.149090909090909 Well confidential films that have like 	
MIO036 	1551.95	1553.82	0.625454545454545 Ten thousand twenty thousand 	
FIE038 	1553.99	1554.33	0.626181818181818 Uh-huh

MIO036 	1565.68	1567.12	0.628363636363636 Yeah it's not bad at all yeah 	
MIO036 	1568.48	1571.34	0.629090909090909 So yeah anyway if you want a definition of mainstream 	
MIO046 	1572.24	1574.69	0.629818181818182 And sister and also is uh is quite high 	
MIO036 	1574.82	1575.33	0.630545454545455 Uh-huh

MIO036 	1619.53	1620.65	0.653090909090909 so my proposal 	
MIO036 	1621.38	1623.32	0.653818181818182 Which is only a proposal would be too 	
MIO036 	1623.78	1626.02	0.654545454545455 To keep the focus on on 	
MIO036 	1626.5	1626.96	0.655272727272727 Uh 	
MIO036 	1626.96	1631.69	0.0850909090909091 more or less history an action So lawrence of arabia was 	
MIO036 	1632.4	1638.11	0.656 this guy during the first world war so it happens okay outside europe in the states but uh 	
MIO036 	1638.6	1639.86	0.656727272727273 It's a piece of history 	
MIO036 	1640.23	1642.69	0.657454545454545 Uh apocalypse now it's a good number of time 	
FIE038 	1642.88	1643.19	0.658181818181818 Uh-huh 	
MIO036 	1643.42	1643.69	0.658909090909091 Uh 	
MIO036 	1643.69	1644.15	0.659636363636364 um 	
MIO036 	1644.15	1651.62	0.660363636363636 correct and okay but those that's much are much earlier and it's not about it's not violent which is a nice thing i think 	
MIO036 	1652.14	1653.04	0.661090909090909 But um 	
MIO036 	1653.79	1660.83	0.0101818181818182 Given that we would like a movie from the nineties i thought that's saving private ryan of things for project in the document 	
MIO036 	1661.52	1662.35	0.661818181818182 Um 	
MIO036 	1662.35	1666.26	0.662545454545455 woods keep this more or less this team of um 	
MIO036 	1666.26	1669.97	0.663272727272727 history and warren's action drama 	
MIO036 	1671.5	1676.05	0.0785454545454545 actually am very new and i would say if you monastic view on on more 	
MIO036 	1676.47	1678.48	0.664 Because it's it's not like the um 	
MIO036 	1678.48	1684.33	0.664727272727273 sort of glorification of uh you know the good guys that's that uh well go against the nazis 	
MIO036 	1684.88	1685.95	0.665454545454545 But it's uh 	
MIO036 	1685.95	1697.03	0.0232727272727273 it's uh it's well the plot actually if you don't know it It's about people are looking for just one soldier in fact it's a um it's about a a family of four brothers two 	
MIO036 	1697.44	1704.23	0.666181818181818 Actually three of them get killed during the war in these days to forty what i guess summer forty four 	
MIO036 	1705.22	1706.32	0.666909090909091 And uh 	
MIO036 	1706.32	1715.15	0.00581818181818182 well the government decides that they need to get back to force brother Just to save one number of the family and this this guy's private ryan 	
MIO036 	1715.8	1722.68	0.0741818181818182 So the movies not about to killing detriments or whatever it's about saving at least one guy from a family 	
MIO036 	1723.3	1727.18	0.667636363636364 So but of course the the setting use during the war and um 	
MIO036 	1727.18	1730.96	0.0509090909090909 it's a realistic and uh very dramatic in fact it so um 	
MIO036 	1731.34	1737.03	0.159272727272727 It's not all of glorification of war but it's just a It shows a bit that the violence of um 	
MIO036 	1737.65	1740.22	0.130909090909091 Of the things and especially the the beginning is uh 	
MIO036 	1740.95	1745.24	0.668363636363636 I think it's great it's it's very violent that it's it's an image of of four 	
MIO046 	1745.14	1745.6	0.669090909090909 Yeah 	
MIO036 	1745.66	1746.43	0.669818181818182 It's uh 	
MIO046 	1746.39	1747.92	0.670545454545455 It's quite or a ball actually 	
FIE038 	1747.29	1749.1	0.671272727272727 Very of violence 	
MIO036 	1749.01	1752.93	0.672 Yeah but i think if well if you compare it was

FIE038 	1833.98	1840.21	0.000727272727272727 It wasn't until you started doing things like schindler's list and saving private ryan that he actually started winning awards for it 	
MIO046 	1840.14	1842.76	0.699636363636364 No you want for it to you want and um

MIO036 	1850.31	1850.62	0.704 okay 	
MIO036 	1851.78	1856.9	0.160727272727273 yeah that's that's the point it's it's a bit grey and actually if you look at my second page 	
MIO036 	1857.31	1857.72	0.704727272727273 Uh 	
MIO036 	1857.72	1869.63	0.00218181818181818 in the trade yeah i found out that in fact they actually reduced the the colour saturation of the movie just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentaries from the time yeah was very surprised to find the so 	
MIO046 	1865.55	1867.35	0.705454545454545 That was very interesting to it yeah 	
MIO046 	1869.58	1873.96	0.706181818181818 But then they they've read that be really what we're was it 	
MIO036 	1873.87	1876.13	0.0349090909090909 They turn back the colours for uh huh 	
FIE038 	1874.48	1876.51	0.0821818181818182 Leary enhance the colour yeah 	
MIO046 	1875.22	1875.82	0.706909090909091 like to 	
MIO095 	1876.62	1883.11	0.0887272727272727 Because people start to complain that uh i thought that was the problem with the t. v. when they were broadcasting the movie on the t. v. 	
MIO036 	1877.42	1877.79	0.707636363636364 Yeah 	
FIE038 	1878.4	1879.98	0.708363636363636 That is the t. v. is a nice 	
MIO036 	1883.02	1883.44	0.709090909090909 Yeah 	
MIO036 	1883.44	1887.89	0.0516363636363636 so this uh facts number two i think obviously for the technical people white house 	
MIO095 	1887.24	1888.97	0.709818181818182 an interesting point interesting point 	
MIO036 	1888.22	1888.44	0.710545454545455 uh 	
MIO036 	1889.19	1890.67	0.711272727272727 It's it's it's quite funny 	
MIO036 	1891.4	1892.65	0.712 So yeah so i i mean 	
MIO036 	1893.3	1902.28	0.712727272727273 points could serve also it's an introduction if you want to talk for for have a five or ten minutes before the movie and and in in the room 	
MIO036 	1903.12	1903.83	0.713454545454545 So uh yeah 	
MIO036 	1903.83	1906.7	0.714181818181818 um so the this would be my candidate that um 	
MIO046 	1906.35	1909.76	0.714909090909091 And then then there is this a there is any role i 	
MIO036 	1906.7	1907.4	0.715636363636364 very much 	
MIO046 	1910.21	1911.82	0.716363636363636 so all and not euro 	
MIO046 	1912.32	1918.76	0.0865454545454546 And in all the all those two stories know in the previous movies they were in your in your own lawrence of uh be a

MIO046 	1919.38	1920.52	0.718545454545455 Uh an idea was 	
MIO046 	1920.96	1923.95	0.719272727272727 Okay it's now it's also known euro i think that uh 	
FIE038 	1924.29	1924.56	0.72 Yeah
