sridhar And we 78 have to 80 take a 82 decision on the 85 remote 86 control 
sridhar 87 Concepts 
sridhar And uh 90 oh the 92 functional 93 design 
sridhar So we 96 all 97 forty 98 minutes 
sridhar I 100 think it uh 
sridhar It a 105 bit uh 
sridhar 107 no but i i 111 hope we 113 can 114 finish it up 
sridhar So i will 120 hand 121 go to the 
sridhar The 125 functionality 126 into the 128 christian 129 okay 
sridhar to 131 discuss about the the 135 components 136 Concept 
christine 137 Okay 
christine So uh 140 if you 142 could 143 open the 145 powerpoint 146 presentation 
christine And 148 number 149 two 
sridhar 150 Mm but to 
sridhar 153 "kay" 
christine 154 Components 155 design 
christine 156 Okay 
christine to 158 put the 160 slideshow 161 moment 
sridhar The 163 next 164 alright 
christine 165 Right here 
christine Is that that one 171 yes 172 please 
christine 173 Thank you 
christine 175 Oh 176 yes 
christine So well um 
christine We were 182 looking you 184 specifically uh the 187 components so that the 191 following 192 components 193 Not the 195 case the 197 power 198 supply 
christine Uh 
christine 200 means of 202 communications with the 205 television 206 set 
christine And 208 then 209 since we 211 talked about 213 using 214 some 215 sort of 217 speech 218 recognition 219 have to 221 have 222 mike 223 from 224 all 225 made an 227 extra 228 hum 229 have to 231 have 232 mike 233 found in the 236 device 
christine But um 
christine 239 Maybe to 241 have it uh 
christine A 245 way it 247 has to 249 pass to here at the 254 speaker And um 
christine so it 259 could be in the 263 television 264 set 265 could be in the 269 device but 271 Summary 272 have to 274 put the 276 microphone 
christine Um 
christine and a 280 way of 282 making 283 beeps or 285 sounds you 287 can 288 find it when it 292 gets 293 lost 
christine Um 
christine so the 297 other one 299 thing that we 302 sort Are 304 method For 
christine One about this as we 311 have 312 looked at uh of the 317 store it it 320 torque or 322 record what 324 work 325 has 326 not 
christine And 328 then we 330 also um 
ed 332 Mm 
christine One to 335 evaluate 336 some 337 new 338 materials and we 341 contacted 342 manufacturing for their 345 input 346 because 
christine 347 Course 348 stream 
christine 349 Might 350 come up and 353 choose the 355 material that 357 then 358 manufacturing did 360 not 361 have the 363 technologies 364 capabilities to 366 offer us so well this is the 373 approach that which uh 377 during our um 
christine our 381 research 
christine So um 
christine for the 386 case 
christine Um 
christine we at 390 all we were 393 making a 395 specification 396 specific 397 assumption that it 400 would be 402 curved and 404 design 405 course 406 now i 408 wanted it to be 412 expendable and 414 shrink a 416 ball but 
christine Um 
christine that that does 422 not 423 seem to be one of the 429 year 430 choice 431 not 432 option we 434 can 
christine We 436 can really 438 serious the 440 explorer 
christine So 442 then we were 445 thinking about um 
christine 448 rubber but um 
christine 451 Unfortunately that 453 gonna 454 because of the 457 sheets uh 
christine 459 factor and um 
christine that 463 might be 465 some 
christine 466 Problems with them uh how it 
christine It 473 goes with the 476 board 
christine Uh 
christine and uh 480 then 481 plastic 482 also 483 has its 485 problems 486 melt 487 saying and it 490 brittle it is 493 brittle 494 laughter 495 while so i 498 still 499 had 500 thai 501 titanium and and what 505 available 
ed 506 Mm 
christine But um 
christine 509 unfortunately uh 
christine uh 512 titanium 513 also 514 gonna 515 laminated the them 518 people and 520 manufacturing 521 said that you 524 could 525 make 526 curved 527 case a 529 set of 531 titanium 532 although 
christine 533 Apple do it with 
christine 537 Power but i 540 not 541 quite 542 sure but 
christine At 545 nevertheless so um the 549 eliminated 550 all of our 553 options 554 except what 
christine So 
agnes 557 Financially 558 friendly 
christine This is our 562 flying 
christine And it is she 567 said it 569 environmentally 570 friendly a 572 mature or so 
christine were 576 correctly uh 578 proposing 
christine Uh we will 582 get 583 oh my 585 personal 586 preferences in 588 just a 590 sec so 592 there this 594 other 595 matter of the 598 chips and um 
christine well we 603 could 604 use a 606 simple 607 design on the 610 board but uh this 614 simple 615 chips but that 618 only 619 works for the 622 buttons you do 625 not 626 get very 628 much um 
christine 630 intelligence with the 633 simple one 
christine And um 
christine 637 then 638 there was a 641 regular which 
christine I 644 regret that i 647 have 648 forgotten 649 exactly what 
christine Why um well 654 emanating that one 
christine Uh the 659 other 660 option was is 663 advanced 664 chip on 666 print 
christine And uh we 670 like we we 673 found that it it 677 includes is 679 infrared 680 sender which we 683 member the 685 beam was that was an 690 important 691 component of 693 finding the 695 right 696 chip 
christine And and 699 manufacturing as 701 tall as they they 705 if i um 
christine uh 709 recently 710 developed a uh a 714 sensor and a 717 speaker at that 720 would that be 723 integrated 724 into this 726 advanced 727 chip on 729 print so 
christine Uh we we uh 
christine 735 Yeah 736 jen 737 thing 738 right you are 741 personal 742 preferences 
christine Well um 
christine i 
christine 746 think we 748 should you 750 know you 752 some of us 755 some 756 real 757 exotic 758 words 
christine 759 Like um 
christine you 762 know uh 
christine well you 766 guys 767 come 768 from 769 tropical 770 country so you 773 can 774 can 775 think of 777 some 778 trees 779 than 780 some 781 nice 782 words i 784 think that 
christine 786 People 787 might really 789 want to 791 design their 793 own 794 cases to 796 see they 798 could do 800 through the the 
christine 803 dimensional 804 design on the 807 internet and 809 then they 811 could 812 submit their 814 orders 815 can 816 like you 818 submit a 820 custom 821 car or do or you 826 know when you 829 can 830 choose the 832 colour and 834 size of the 837 wheels and the 840 colours of the 843 weather and 845 things 846 like that and 849 then i uh i 853 think we 855 should 856 go with the 859 solar 860 cells as well as the um 
ed You 867 know 
christine the 869 microphone and 871 speaker on the 874 advanced 875 chip 
christine So the so the 880 findings of our 883 research and my 886 recommendations 
christine Um 
christine for the 890 new 891 remote 892 control well 894 mm 895 would be to 898 have um 
christine 900 Have be 902 made out of 905 wood 
christine 906 Any 907 problems with a 
sridhar 910 Can you 912 go 913 back uh one 916 slide 
christine I 918 not 919 sure uh well i do 924 not 925 see it 927 go 928 back here 
sridhar 930 Yeah it uh 
sridhar our 934 costs and uh 
sridhar uh 
sridhar What 939 mean 940 exactly a a 943 once a 945 chip on 947 print what 949 meaning of that 
christine I 953 think it um 
christine 956 no um 
christine a 959 multiple uh 
christine 961 chip 962 design um 
ed 964 Mm 
christine and it that 968 may be 970 printed on to the 974 circuit 975 board 
christine Uh 
christine it i 979 could 980 find out 982 more about that uh 
sridhar Is it 988 means it on this 
christine the for the 995 next a 997 next 998 meeting 
sridhar 999 Yeah is it on uh 1004 michael was my 1007 control 1008 set 1009 based or or uh 
christine I do 1015 not 1016 know but i will 1020 find out 1022 more our 1024 next 1025 meeting 
sridhar 1026 Okay that that 1029 would be 1031 great so 1033 if you 1035 find out 1037 know 1038 technology 1039 background 1040 okay so that 1043 would be 1045 cord 
christine 1046 Sounds 1047 good 
agnes Why the 1050 plastic 1051 eliminated as a 1054 possible to 
christine 1056 Because um 
christine it 1059 gets a 1061 little 
christine 1062 Cracks 
agnes 1063 Uh-huh 
christine Um 
christine We 1066 want we 1068 expect these um 
christine And these 1073 remote 1074 controls to be 1077 around for 1079 several 1080 hundred 1081 years 
christine So 
agnes What 
ed Well i 
ed 1086 Right but it 1089 fresh as well 1092 after 1093 s. 1094 i. 
christine 1095 Ah to 1097 speak for itself up 1101 there 
agnes Well i 1104 think 
agnes I 1106 think what the 1109 way that you 1112 ran in the 1115 same 1116 types of 1118 problems with me i 1122 mean it 1124 yeah so it 1127 if you 1129 drop 1130 bit 
agnes It i 1133 not so it 
sridhar 1136 See on a 1139 comment about the 
ed I 1143 find where to 1146 sell it 
christine 1148 Yeah 1149 oh well 
ed 1151 Ready to 1153 sell it 
agnes 1155 If you we 1158 if he is really 1162 good 1163 quality what it that 1167 might 1168 work but you 1171 can 1172 just 1173 use 
ed 1174 No it 1176 not 1177 no 1178 no 1179 no the 1181 only one 1183 delay 1184 would you 1186 can 1187 use of the 1190 ones that are 1193 hard it 1195 hard 1196 work but 1198 there 1199 some very 1201 pretty 1202 close that 1204 there 
christine And you 1207 can 
christine It a 1210 little 1211 sweater to 1213 take 1214 care of 
agnes 1216 Yeah 1217 exactly 1218 yeah 
christine 1219 Oh i 1221 glad 
ed That 1223 actually very 1225 innovative 1226 idea 
christine 1227 O. 1228 k. 1229 i. 1230 c. 1231 r. and 1233 r. 1234 time 1235 people 1236 remote 1237 control of my uh it 
ed 1242 Let 1243 have a very 
ed 1246 different 1247 idea that uh 
ed you 1251 can 1252 choose you 1254 colour 1255 would you 1257 type of what 
agnes The 1261 stain 
ed I 1263 mean 1264 each 1265 person they 1267 have their 1269 personalised 1270 individualised 1271 Speech 1272 recognition 1273 remote 1274 control and what it 
ed 1278 Not on the 1281 market 
sridhar 1282 Yeah so it it 1286 looks 1287 got the the 1290 design the 1292 function 1293 design uh what about a 1298 year you 1300 know 
agnes Um 
agnes In 1303 terms of 1305 comments on that so in 1310 terms of my 1313 own 1314 mm 
sridhar 1315 Yes 1316 yes 1317 yes 
ed 1318 Because of well i 
sridhar In 1323 terms of 1325 comments 1326 cost 
agnes 1327 Yeah 
agnes 1328 yeah 
christine She 1330 works and 1332 keep the 1334 context a 1336 nice to she that she was a 1343 real 1344 little 1345 bit 1346 prepared for 
agnes 1348 Yeah 
ed But 
christine But the 1352 way 1353 yeah it was 1356 not 
ed Well i 
agnes I 1360 think that the 1363 quality 1364 materials that 1366 then It 1368 should 1369 not 1370 influence the 1372 design 1373 principles to 1375 match which you will 1379 see with my 1382 presentation When 1384 think we 1386 would 1387 have to 1389 check those what the 1393 user 1394 whether How 1396 quickly the 1398 novelty 1399 wears 1400 off of 1402 having 
christine 1403 Uh-huh 
christine That you 1406 would 1407 wanna 1408 have to 1410 have 1411 splinters and and what you 1416 using 1417 yeah 
agnes 1418 Yeah 
agnes for 1420 example 
agnes So 
agnes 1422 Have to 1424 see how 
agnes 1426 Kid 1427 friendly and it and it 
agnes And 1433 all that but 
christine So you 1438 if you do i 1442 get 1443 ahold of it they 1447 can 1448 use it 
christine For 1451 teething 
ed I do 1454 any with the 1457 rubber 1458 plastic so 
christine 1460 Yeah they do it with 1465 other 1466 materials as well 1469 yeah 
ed 1470 Sure 
ed 1471 Joe 1472 more 
sridhar 1473 Okay 1474 then uh 1476 let 1477 more to uh 
sridhar 1480 acne 
sridhar So 1482 mm 
sridhar You 1484 know in 1486 parts 1487 bin to it 
agnes 1490 Three 
agnes Uh 
agnes 1492 yeah 
sridhar So 
agnes I 1495 think so 1497 yeah 
agnes So it a very 1502 short 1503 presentation 1504 "cause" i 1506 actually 1507 gonna 1508 draw you the 1511 layout on the 1514 board so 
agnes 1516 If you 1518 wanna 1519 discuss 1520 stick to the 1523 second 1524 slide 
agnes Um 
agnes which 1527 basically 1528 shows is 1530 sort of 1532 like to the 1535 ideas that we 1538 talking about 1540 last 1541 time 
agnes Um 
agnes and 1544 try to 1546 put that 1548 into the 1550 remote 1551 control so 1553 things it you 1556 can 1557 actually 1558 see on i i 1562 have a on 1565 off 1566 switch 1567 Volume and 1569 channel 1570 control them 1572 any 1573 access 1574 button 
agnes 1575 Ergonomic 1576 shape which are 1579 completely 1580 agree for 1582 scenes 1583 idea to 1585 have it 1587 sort of 1589 moulded so it 1592 slightly 1593 more 1594 ergonomic and 1596 comfortable to 1598 hold on the 1601 standard Very 1603 straight 1604 remote 1605 controls 1606 Actually the 1608 thing with the 1611 word 1612 if we 1614 take your 1616 customising 1617 idea is that 
agnes 1620 actually do 1622 sort of 1624 quasi 1625 measurements on their 1628 hand 1629 size of 1631 someone as 1633 large your 1635 hands You 1637 have a 1639 wider 1640 remote 1641 control 
christine 1642 Right my 1644 hand it 1646 different 1647 size 1648 then you 1650 worse for 1652 example 
agnes So that 1655 takes a really 1658 good 1659 idea to 1661 estimate 1662 customise 1663 ability 
agnes Um one 1666 thing i 1668 thought 1669 might be 1671 kind of 1673 interesting is to 1676 put a 1678 flipscreen i 1680 just 1681 like you 1683 have one 1685 flip 1686 phones 
agnes So that you do 1691 not 1692 have this 1694 case where 1696 someone 1697 sits on the 1700 remote 1701 controller 1702 accidentally 1703 press their 1705 hand on 1707 especially 1708 get 1709 little 1710 kids 1711 around They 1713 not 1714 pressing the 1716 buttons well you 1719 trying to 1721 watch a 1723 t. 1724 v. 1725 show and 1727 accidentally 1728 change the 1730 channel or 1732 turn it 1734 off 
christine 1735 hmm 
agnes And 1737 also 
agnes Um you 1740 have 1741 issues of 1743 batteries are 1745 aiming at 1747 said that 1749 maybe we 1751 could 1752 put a 1754 little 1755 battery 1756 life 1757 like 
agnes On it 1760 kinda 1761 goes 1762 demand 1763 demand them as your 1767 battery it 1769 starts to 1771 die 
agnes And in 1774 terms of 1776 invisible 
agnes and um 1779 tax uh 1781 feedback on 1783 button 1784 presses 
christine 1785 Hmm 
christine 1786 hmm 
agnes And 1788 Like you 1790 said 1791 speech 1792 recognition 
agnes So in 1795 terms 
agnes this 1797 thing that 1799 actually 1800 look 1801 like 
agnes 1802 Despite 1803 working in 1805 interface 1806 designer 1807 not the 1809 greatest 1810 artists in the 1813 world so you 1816 have to 1818 forgive me 
agnes You 1821 have 1822 something 1823 like 
agnes an on 1826 off 1827 switch really 1829 big 1830 Sort of in a 1834 corner and by itself so you do 1841 not 1842 accidentally 1843 turn the 1845 t. 1846 v. 1847 off are are 1850 trying to 1852 manoeuvre 1853 other 1854 buttons 
agnes And 1856 then you 1858 have 1859 sort of one of those 1864 topple 1865 display is 
agnes For 1868 oops 
agnes 1869 Channels 
agnes And 1871 volume 1872 sort of for 1875 surfing 1876 channels and 1878 then 1879 volume so the 1882 volume 1883 would be the up and 1888 down 1889 volume 1890 goes up and 1893 down and 1895 then 1896 channels 1897 left or 1899 right 
agnes And 1901 then here you 1904 have your 1906 sort of 1908 standard 
agnes 1909 Telephone 1910 ish 
agnes 1911 Number 1912 pad 
agnes And 1914 then on one 1917 side you 1919 would 1920 have an 1922 access to the 1925 manual 
agnes On your 1928 t. 1929 v. And on the 1933 other 1934 side 
agnes A 1936 way to 1938 turn 1939 off the 1941 voice 1942 control 
agnes So that 1945 if the 1947 user does 1949 not 1950 want to 1952 use the 1954 voice they 1956 can 1957 just 1958 turn it 1960 off and you do 1964 not 1965 have a 1967 remote 1968 control 1969 Accidentally 
christine 1970 Mm 
christine 1971 Uh-huh 
agnes 1972 Changing 1973 things on 1975 yeah 
agnes Um 
agnes so 1978 again you 1980 can 1981 have a 1983 little 1984 l. 1985 c. 1986 d. 1987 light 1988 somewhere 
agnes The 1990 flat 
agnes 1991 Thing and the 1994 forgotten 1995 anything 
agnes I do 1998 not 1999 think so 
agnes So as you 2004 can 2005 see it a very very 2010 simple 2011 design which is one of the 2017 things i really 2020 wanted to 2022 keep 
agnes 2023 simple 2024 not 2025 have 2026 too 2027 many 2028 buttons that 2030 have to me 2033 functionalities 2034 trying to it 
agnes I 2038 think the 2040 design 2041 can 2042 pretty 2043 much 2044 carry 
agnes 2045 everything 2046 although With the 2049 world the 2051 flipscreen 
agnes 2052 Might 2053 have to do 2056 something 2057 slightly 
christine A 2059 hinge 
agnes 2060 Difference 
christine We 2062 have to 2064 copper 2065 hand 2066 sure you 2068 know 
agnes 2069 Yeah 
agnes It does 2072 have will 2074 start 2075 watching uh for the 2079 weight is 2081 depending on how 2084 much the the 2087 flipscreen will 2089 add to the 2092 way 
christine 2093 Mm 2094 hmm 
agnes Of the 2097 remote 2098 control you do 2101 not 2102 want it to 2105 start 2106 getting 2107 too 2108 happy 
agnes But that the 2112 general 2113 layout with the 2116 general 2117 functionalities 2118 if we 2120 come up with 2123 something 2124 else 
agnes As you 2127 can 2128 see 2129 there 2130 still 2131 lots of 2133 space on the 2136 actual 2137 remote 2138 control 
agnes And 2140 if you do a 2144 customisable 2145 e. You 2147 could 2148 make this 2150 thing 2151 fairly 2152 small 2153 fairly 2154 all 2155 large 
christine 2156 Mm 2157 hmm 
agnes 2158 Depending on 2160 personal 2161 preferences 
agnes So that 2164 pretty 2165 much 
agnes 2166 Oh i 2168 had to 2170 say i 2172 mean 2173 everything 2174 else in 2176 terms of 2178 design 2179 issues 
agnes this 2181 century 2182 know the 2184 keypad and 
agnes The 2187 channel is 2189 just 2190 depending on where you 2194 from it is 
agnes And you 2199 tend to 2201 use the the 2204 volume 2205 control and uh 
agnes The 2209 browsing 2210 more 2211 than the 2213 actual 2214 number 2215 pad so that 2218 would be 2220 sort of 2222 interact 2223 line for your 2226 time 2227 goes when you 2230 holding the 2232 remote 2233 control 
christine 2234 Mm 
agnes That 2236 number 2237 have 2238 little 2239 bit 2240 lower to 2242 use 2243 less 2244 frequently 
christine 2245 Mm 2246 hmm 
agnes So 2248 once we 2250 decide 2251 exactly what we 2254 want 2255 then we 2257 can 2258 figure out the 2261 exact 2262 positioning 
agnes But 2264 more or 2266 less i 2268 think it 2270 should 2271 go 2272 along those 2274 lines 
sridhar So what your 2278 yeah 
sridhar The 2280 comments or uh 
ed 2283 Simple 2284 design 
ed So 2286 consumers 2287 want 
sridhar 2288 Okay 
ed 2289 Some of 2291 like 2292 fifteen we 2294 have a 2296 product i i 
agnes I 
ed 2300 Problems 2301 obviously 2302 gonna be 
agnes 2304 Uh-huh 
ed 2305 Okay i 2307 also 2308 have of 
ed Very 2311 simple 
ed 2312 Presentation 
sridhar 2313 Yeah 
ed But 2315 from a 2317 marketing 2318 point you 2320 have to 2322 see what the 2325 consumers 2326 want 
ed 2327 Also 2328 have well 
ed 2330 Copied uh 
ed 2332 Different 2333 type of 2335 remote 
ed 2336 If you 2338 can 2339 find me where i at 
ed 2344 Should we be one in here 
ed 2350 Sure 2351 sure 
christine 2352 Sure 
ed Being 2354 modified 
ed For 2356 stealing our 2358 product 
ed With the 2361 municipal 2362 questionnaires and 2364 every 2365 year is 2367 because it was a 2371 cinetis you 2373 would 2374 come 2375 most 2376 consumers are 2378 looking for 2380 today This is the 2384 trends 2385 changing very very 2388 quickly 
ed In 2390 six 2391 months 2392 maybe this 2394 ideas 2395 already 2396 got out the 2399 window So 
ed be a 2403 question how 2405 fast we 2407 can 2408 act 
ed 2409 Yeah 
ed uh 
ed they are your 2414 wrist 2415 wrist am i 2418 know 
christine 2419 No 
christine 2420 Go to 2422 findings 
ed 2423 No 2424 no 
ed 2425 No 
ed So i do 2429 not 2430 know the 2432 commentator 
ed the 2434 market 2435 trend 
ed This is what we 2440 know 2441 from the 2443 last uh or 2446 from the 2448 questionnaires and 2450 although 2451 although 2452 Surveys we 2454 have done 2456 fancy and 2458 feel 2459 good that what we 2463 looking for 2465 something that 2467 feels 2468 good in the 2471 hand that 2473 easy to 2475 use 
ed But 2477 different 2478 next 2479 generation of 2481 innovation 2482 because 2483 all the 2485 remote out 2487 there 2488 now they 2490 all very 2492 similar they will do the 2497 same 2498 thing 
ed We 2500 have to 2502 something 2503 completely 2504 different 
ed 2505 "kay" 2506 easy to 2508 use as well as 2512 become 2513 has 2514 become 2515 another 2516 major 2517 interest that the 
ed With the 2522 whiteboard we 2524 can 2525 see that uh 2528 remote that 2530 easy to 
ed And i 2534 think this is 2537 another 2538 thing is 2540 interesting is the 2543 consumers 2544 actually 2545 willing to 2547 pay the 2549 price for 2551 exciting to 2553 have 2554 technology 
ed So we 2557 have we 2559 have a 2561 product that 2563 may be 2565 more 2566 expensive 
ed 2567 If it 2569 comes out 2571 right 
ed 2572 If they did 2575 not 2576 look it 2578 looks and 2580 feels 2581 good to 2583 have 2584 technology 
ed The 2586 second 2587 two you 2589 can 2590 see the 2592 last one is a very 2597 easy 2598 simple 2599 design 
ed The 2601 second one is about uh 2606 forty 2607 five 2608 thousand 2609 different 2610 buttons on it which 2614 makes it very 2617 hard to 2619 read for an 2622 i. 2623 d. is the 2626 first one i 2629 see 
ed But they 2632 put in a 2635 display 
ed That is 2638 something 2639 also with a 2642 little 2643 flip up 2645 now we 2647 adding 2648 all 2649 kinds of 2651 things and a 2654 little 2655 flip up 2657 if you 2659 have a 2661 little 2662 display on the 2665 flip up the 2668 wanna 2669 close it 2671 everything 2672 locked 
ed 2673 Maybe the 2675 display 2676 also 2677 makes it 2679 easier to 2681 use 2682 because 2683 sometimes in your 2686 looking for 2688 buttons 2689 maybe 2690 if you 2692 see a 2694 display 
christine 2695 Context 2696 instead of 2698 instructions 
agnes 2699 Right 
ed 2700 Okay 
christine I 2702 mean with the 2705 top what 2707 mode the 2709 t. 2710 v. you the 2713 d. 2714 v. 2715 d. or 2717 something 2718 else to 2720 say and 
ed 2722 "cause" i 2724 have 2725 seen 2726 mostly the 2728 standard 2729 ones 2730 yeah 
agnes 2731 Especially 2732 many 2733 something 2734 like that for 2737 training the 2739 speech 2740 recognition 
ed 2741 Now you 2743 have as 2745 many 2746 have one with a very 2751 simple 2752 also the 2754 idea 2755 simple but with the 2759 display So you 2762 can 2763 see which are 2766 going 
agnes 2767 Uh-huh 
ed So 2769 maybe 2770 three in 2772 incorporate the 2774 easiness of 2776 use 
ed 2777 Train be 2779 fancy 
ed 2780 Feels 2781 good 
ed Uh 
ed With the 2785 display 
ed 2786 Would 2787 designer 2788 would 2789 design 2790 colours 
ed Mine 
christine 2792 Yeah 2793 maybe which you 2796 could do is 
christine 2799 video 2800 orders the 2802 device 
christine You 2804 could 2805 send them 2807 like um 
christine He uh 
christine At 2812 some 
christine 2813 foam 2814 rubber 
christine Um 
christine 2816 Ball And 2818 then they 2820 would 2821 squeeze it you 2824 would 2825 take the 2827 shape of 
agnes 2829 Arrow 2830 yeah 
agnes 2831 Yeah so it really 2835 moulded to do it to your 2841 specific 
christine To to it it it in and 2849 then you 2851 would 
christine Um 
christine what the 2855 geometry of their 2858 hands 2859 would be 2861 e. and uh 
ed 2864 Hard 2865 disk 2866 reason i 
ed 2868 Resisted 2869 resisted i uh 
christine You 2873 know what i 2876 know what 
agnes I 
agnes But the for that you 2884 would 2885 also 2886 have to do 2889 sort of an 2892 average 2893 across 2894 families and 2896 things 2897 like that 2899 if 2900 Unless 2901 everyone 2902 has their 2904 own 2905 personal 2906 remote 
christine That 2908 right that 2910 right you 2912 would 2913 not 2914 wanna 2915 go 2916 too 2917 far 2918 down that 
christine 2920 Oh that that 2923 actually 2924 would uh 2926 increase the um 
christine the 2930 revenue it so we 2934 could 2935 expect 2936 yeah 
agnes To 2938 say i 
sridhar I 2941 hope so 
ed 2943 No but 2945 incorporating the 2947 three uh 
ed 2949 Obviously be 2951 something 
ed on the 2954 market 
agnes 2955 Yeah 
ed 2956 Totally 2957 different 
ed 2958 Yeah 
ed for my 
agnes 2961 Already the 2963 customisable really is 
agnes A really 2968 good 2969 sort of 
ed Well what it was the the uh was a 2980 nokia 2981 taking 2982 all of those 
agnes 2985 New 2986 gimmick 
ed 2987 Changeable 2988 colours 2989 Right you 2991 take a 2993 part for 2995 another 2996 face 2997 take it 2999 off 3000 button 3001 interface 
agnes 3002 Yeah 
christine 3003 hmm 
christine 3004 Right 
ed And 3006 then they 3008 sold 3009 millions 
agnes That a a 
ed 3013 Millions 
ed So 
ed And so with that do the 3021 findings were the 3024 researched 3025 easy to 
ed 3027 whole you 3029 know 
ed We 3031 have to 3033 come up with 3036 something 3037 totally 3038 new 3039 there 3040 not on the 3043 market 
christine But 3045 also 3046 have to 3048 work um 
christine 3050 consider that to who we were 3056 gonna 3057 get to 3059 make this 3061 custom 3062 cases in 3064 terms of 3066 manufacturing 3067 process 3068 system 3069 right 
christine 3070 Right um 
christine 3072 Learn about um 
christine 3075 labour 3076 wires 
christine You 3078 know and 3080 Different 3081 countries and so 3084 forth so we 3087 can do it 3090 cheap but you do 3094 not 3095 wanna 3096 explore it to uh 
christine 3100 labour and um 
christine 3103 third 3104 world 3105 countries 
christine 3106 Actually that 3108 right you 3110 turn 3111 around and 3113 say they your um for the 3119 reason the 3121 cost is 3123 high for the 3126 devices 3127 because 
christine you 3129 paying uh a 3132 working 3133 wage to the 3136 person who 3138 made 
christine The 3140 device 
agnes 3141 Uh-huh 
sridhar 3142 Yeah but we 3145 can 3146 get the 3148 production and uh 
sridhar 3151 Confuse 3152 like uh 
christine 3154 Cost of 3156 living is 3158 low 
sridhar in the uh 3162 yes 3163 yes and 3165 disliking 3166 d. or a 3169 chain or a 3172 mono 3173 ratio so 
sridhar You 3176 can 3177 go a 3179 bit of 3181 features 3182 then but the 3185 price 3186 any 3187 kind 3188 some 3189 more 
sridhar So 
christine That 3192 would that be 3195 something that 3197 manufacturing 3198 would 3199 have to um 
sridhar 3202 Yeah 
sridhar 3203 Yeah so 
christine 3205 Explore 3206 more 3207 into where 
ed Where are we are we in 3215 any 3216 fashion is is 
christine 3219 Uh-huh 
ed 3220 Than 3221 other 3222 stuff We here to 
sridhar 3226 Yeah so 
sridhar 3228 Yes uh but uh but that that they 3236 ca 3237 not that we 3240 can 3241 talk about the 3244 production 3245 later 3246 okay 3247 depends on the the 3251 quantity 3252 okay 
ed 3253 Come up with a 3257 nice 3258 product 
christine 3259 Hmm 
christine 3260 hmm 
sridhar So we do 3264 not 3265 need to 3267 have uh well one uh 3272 fabric 3273 factor or 3275 something so we 3278 can 3279 have a 3281 have it will 
sridhar 3284 There are do the 3288 fabric 3289 okay but the 3292 different uh 
sridhar 3294 electronics 3295 items 3296 then we 3298 can 3299 have a 3301 business 3302 step and the the 3306 good the 3308 cost 3309 okay 
sridhar to 3311 sell 3312 more 
sridhar So that the 3316 led 3317 lights to 3319 decide 3320 foster 3321 board uh 
sridhar 3323 oh 3324 components 3325 concept and uh 3328 interface 3329 concept 
sridhar 3330 Okay 3331 if it is 
sridhar 3334 Picks up the 3337 phone for 3339 both of you what uh 
sridhar it was 3346 talking 
sridhar And you are 3350 design 
sridhar With uh 
sridhar 3353 oh you 3355 wanna the 3357 display or 3359 bit of a 3362 display or 3364 just a 3366 simple so 
agnes I 3369 think it 3371 depends i 3373 mean i 3375 think it a 3378 good 3379 idea that we 3382 need to really 3385 think about how 3388 useful it 3390 gonna be 3392 because 3393 theoretically with the 3396 t. 3397 v. you 3399 already 3400 have 
agnes A 3402 big 3403 display 3404 right in 3406 front of you 3409 know 
christine 3410 Hmm 
agnes So 
agnes 3412 If we 3414 trying to 3416 keep 3417 costs 3418 down 
agnes 3419 Then 3420 maybe 3421 sacrifice in the 3424 display 
christine 3425 Uh-huh 
agnes Is a 3428 way to 3430 go out and it 3434 depends on how 3437 much 3438 putting a 3440 display 3441 costs And what it 3445 would be 3447 used for very 3450 specifically 3451 would it 3453 would be 3455 used for 
christine 3457 Hmm 
christine 3458 hmm 
agnes 3459 "cause" 3460 if it 3462 only 3463 use for one 3466 little 3467 thing 3468 then 3469 putting in a 3472 big 3473 display 
agnes Or a 3476 big 3477 display that 
agnes 3479 Probably 3480 expensive 3481 just to do the 3485 training on the 3488 chip 
agnes For the 3491 speech 3492 recognition or 3494 whatever 
agnes 3495 May 3496 not be the 3499 most 3500 cost 3501 efficient 3502 way to 3504 go but 
agnes That a 3508 sort of 3510 speculation i 3512 mean 
christine We 3514 think uh 3516 jean 
christine You 3518 like the 3520 display in one of the 3525 concepts that you 3528 share 
christine Um 
christine you 3531 know how 3533 much it 3535 costs uh uh 
christine 3538 mm to to 3541 add a 3543 little 3544 display 3545 like that uh 
ed 3548 No one 3550 knows 
christine You 3552 want a 3554 connection i am to 3558 go 3559 find out 
ed 3561 have to 3563 find that 3565 cost 
christine 3566 Okay 
christine 3567 Sorry about that 
ed And 3571 last a 3573 problem i 3575 mean for them 3578 pushing it 3580 after it 3582 made 3583 i. 3584 either 3585 market it i 
ed 3588 Once we 3590 get a 3592 price on that we 3596 can 
christine So but The 3600 advanced 3601 chip-on-print is what um 
christine what we 3607 have 
christine We 3609 have 3610 decided we 3612 determined in the uh 
christine 3616 Engineering 3617 industrial 3618 design is the 3621 recommendation 
christine And um 
christine i 3625 think we 3627 have 3628 kinda 3629 come to 3631 some 3632 Agreement 3633 regarding um 
christine This 3636 concept of a 3639 wooden 3640 case 
agnes 3641 Uh-huh 
christine Uh 3643 customisable um 
ed 3645 Nice 3646 beautiful 3647 mahogany 3648 redwoods 3649 cases 
agnes What about that 3653 Buttons 3654 would 
agnes With the 3657 buttons be 3659 would 3660 say 3661 over 
christine Uh 
christine i do 3665 not 3666 think so 
sridhar I do 3670 not 3671 think so 
christine 3673 No i 3675 think they 3677 could be 3679 rubber 3680 like they 
sridhar 3682 Yes 
christine so you 3685 have a 3687 tactile 3688 experience of 
sridhar 3690 Yes

sridhar Or what we will do is uh 
sridhar we will we will 3709 stick with the the 3713 simple 3714 design for 3716 coming 3717 into the 3719 egg 3720 find out about 3723 know how 3725 much it 3727 cost of 3729 extra 3730 think 3731 if we 3733 go for the 3736 display 
sridhar 3737 Okay 
sridhar so 3739 maybe what you 3742 can do is uh about a 3748 few you 3750 can 3751 come up with the 
sridhar The 3756 product 3757 right
